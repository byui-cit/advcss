			<h1>Layout: Get out of your Ruts!</h1>
                        
			<hr />
			<div class="callout">
			
    <p>The last few years have been really exciting for web designers/developers.  With the arrival and support for things like Flexbox, CSS Grid, and others we finally have not just good...but great tools to accomplish our layouts.</p>
    <p>Suddenly things that we not possible (or at least things that involved a lot of pain to do) are not only possible but in some cases easy to do.  Lets take this opportunity to get out of ruts and experiment with these new tools.</p>
    </div>
			<h2>Activity</h2>
			
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Begin this activity by watching <a href="http://jensimmons.com/presentation/designing-grid" target="_blank">this great presentation by Jen Simmons on Designing for Grid</a> (~1h10 long).</p>
			<p>This <a href="http://jensimmons.com/presentation/modern-layouts-getting-out-our-ruts" target="_blank">presentation</a> (optional) is also very good.  It spends more time with code.</p>
			
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; Once you are done spend a little time looking at the example of printed design below.  Choose one side or the other and think about how it might translate into a webpage.  Think in particular about how you would reformat it to work on a mobile sized screen.  Create a wireframe showing how you would present the content.</p>
			<figure>
			            <img src="../images/dailyPoetryPoster.jpg" alt="image of a poster">
			         </figure>
			
			
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 03:</span> Now create the mobile version of your layout. After you have the mobile one working, move to the desktop version. You can use whatever images you would like for the site.</p>
			<div class="callout">
			    <p>Here are a few resources that might help while creating your poster. </p>
