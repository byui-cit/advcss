			<h1>Layout: Get out of your Ruts!</h1>
                        
			<hr />
			
			<div class="callout">
			
    <p>The last few years have been really exciting for web designers/developers.  With the arrival and support for things like Flexbox, CSS Grid, and others we finally have not just good...but great tools to accomplish our layouts.</p>
    <p>Suddenly things that we not possible (or at least things that involved a lot of pain to do) are not only possible but in some cases easy to do.  Lets take this opportunity to get out of ruts and experiment with these new tools.</p>
    </div>
			<h2>Activity</h2>
			
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Begin this activity by looking for inspiration.  Watch <a href="http://jensimmons.com/presentation/designing-grid" target="_blank">this great presentation by Jen Simmons on Designing for Grid</a> (~1h10 long).</p>
			<p>This <a href="http://jensimmons.com/presentation/modern-layouts-getting-out-our-ruts" target="_blank">presentation</a> (optional) is also very good.  It spends more time with code.</p>
			
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; Once you are done spend a little time looking at examples of printed design.  This could be in magazines, posters, books, etc.  Choose one page layout that you would like to convert to HTML/CSS.</p>
			<div class="callout">
			    <p>Here is a few ideas to get you started on your search if you need them. Find something that you think will push you a bit...but don't go too complex :)</p>
			    <ul>
			        <li><a href="https://julesforrest.com/css-grid-experiments/" target="_blank">Jules Forrest Grid Experiments</a> </li>
			        <li><a href="https://design.tutsplus.com/articles/20-magazine-templates-with-creative-print-layout-designs--cms-26455" target="_blank">TutsPlus 20 Magazine Layouts</a> </li>
			        <li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/269864202652537078/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> </li>
			        <li><a href="https://www.ibooksauthortemplates.com/templates/details/Editorial" target="_blank">Editorial Template</a> </li>
			    </ul>
			    
			    
			</div>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 03:</span>&nbsp; Take your selected layout and think about how you would present it on a mobile device.  Create a wireframe showing this.</p>
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 04:</span> Now create the mobile version of your layout. After you have the mobile one working, move to the desktop version.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 05:</span> Upload your layout, image, and wireframe to iLearn.</p>
			<h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mobile Wireframe produced for a print layout. 5pts</li>
        <li>Responsive layout created that matches print example. 10pts</li>
        
        
    </ul>
