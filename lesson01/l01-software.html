        <h1>Lesson 1: Software Installation</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          This semester we will be using several tools as we learn more about
          HTML and CSS. Below is the list of things you will need to install and
          setup. Even though we will not be using many of these for several
          weeks I highly recommend getting them all installed and verified as
          working this week. You will have a much better semester if you do.
        </p>
        <!-- <h2>Ruby</h2>
            <p>We will be learning to use the SASS CSS Preprocessor this semester. SASS must be compiled before sending it to the browser. We will be using a Node.js Sass compiler. Becasue of this make sure to complete the Node installation instructinos above before continuing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To download Ruby for
                    <strong>Windows</strong>, click this link:
                    <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org" target="_blank">http://rubyinstaller.org</a>. No payment or email is necessary. This is a single-click installer. Download
                    version 2.4.x which is located on the left side of the page. When asked if you want to run this software,
                    choose 'run'.</li>
                <li>Those who are using
                    <strong>Mac</strong>, Ruby comes pre-installed (on Mac OS 10.3 or newer). To check which version of Ruby you
                    are running on your Mac, navigate to the Utilities folder in the Application Files. Open Terminal and
                    type (without the quotes): "Ruby -v". Ruby programs can be created using any text editor. Ruby programs
                    and scripts typically end with the .rb extension.</li>
            </ul> -->

        <h2>NODE and NPM</h2>
        <p>
          Node is a Javascript runtime that has gained a lot of popularity in
          the last few years. There are many helpful tools and utilities that
          can be run using it. NPM is the Node Package Manager. It gets
          installed automatically with Node and is used to add and remove
          utilities. (For more detailed instructions visit:&nbsp;

          <li>
            <strong>Run the installer</strong>&nbsp;(the .msi file you
            downloaded in the previous step.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Follow the prompts in the installer</strong>&nbsp;(Accept
            the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and
            accept the default installation settings).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Restart your computer.</strong>&nbsp;You won&rsquo;t be able
            to run Node.js&reg; until you restart your computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            To verify that it worked type the following in the command prompt:
            <code>node -v</code>. &nbsp;If you get the version number back you
            are good to go.

        <p>Mac Users:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Before you can install Node, you&rsquo;ll need to install two other
          applications. Fortunately, once you&rsquo;ve got these on your
          machine, installing Node takes just a few minutes. (for more detailed

            <strong>XCode.</strong>&nbsp;Apple&rsquo;s XCode development
            software is used to build Mac and iOS apps, but it also includes the
            tools you need to compile software for use on your Mac. XCode is
            free and you can find it in the&nbsp;

            Terms. &nbsp;The next step won't work unless you do. If you don't
            want to download and install the full XCode (It's quite large), you
            can install just the developer tools by following

          <li>
            <strong>Homebrew</strong>.&nbsp;Homebrew is a package manager for
            the Mac &mdash; it makes installing most open source software (like
            Node) as simple as writing&nbsp; <code>brew install node</code>. You
            can learn more about Homebrew at the&nbsp;
            <a
              href="http://brew.sh/"

              >Homebrew website</a
            >. To install Homebrew just open Terminal and type:
            <pre><code class="bash">ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</code></pre>
            You&rsquo;ll see messages in the Terminal explaining what you need
            to do to complete the installation process.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Installing Node.js and NPM is pretty straightforward using Homebrew.
          Homebrew handles downloading, unpacking and installing Node and NPM on
          your system. The whole process (after you have XCode and Homebrew
          installed) should only take you a few minutes.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Open the Terminal app</strong>&nbsp;and type:&nbsp;
            <code>brew install node</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sit back and wait.</strong>&nbsp;Homebrew downloads some
            files and installs them. And that&rsquo;s it.
          </li>
          <li>
            To verify that it worked type the following in the Terminal:
            <code>node -v</code>. &nbsp;If you get the version number back you
            are good to go.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>SASS</h2>
        <ul>
          <p>
            We will be learning to use the SASS CSS Preprocessor this semester.
            SASS must be compiled before sending it to the browser. We will be
            using a Node.js Sass compiler. Becasue of this make sure to complete
            the Node installation instructions above before continuing.
          </p>
          <li>
            <strong>Open your Terminal or Command Prompt.</strong>&nbsp;On the
            Mac the Terminal.app comes installed by default. It's located in
            your Utilities folder. On Windows, run `cmd`.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Install Sass.</strong> In your open terminal window type:
            <code>npm install -g sass</code> This will install Sass and any
            dependencies for you.
          </li>
          <!-- <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Mac:</strong>If you get an error message on the Mac then it's one of two things. First
                        is you may
                        need to use the&nbsp;
                        <code>sudo</code>&nbsp;command to install the Sass gem. It would look like:
                        <code>sudo gem install sass</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>Second you don't have Xcode installed. Follow the
                        <a href="#xcode">directions below</a> and install Xcode then come back and run this command
                        again.</p>
                    <p class="callout">On Windows the Ruby installer does not always add the Ruby executable to the
                        Path so you may get an error
                        saying that 'gem' not found. If you do then go back to Search and enter 'Ruby'. You should see
                        an
                        option for "Start Command Prompt with Ruby" Choose that then run the
                        <kbd>gem install sass</kbd> again. You will only want to use this special CMD window to do this
                        step.
                        For the next step go back to the normal CMD.</p>
                </li> -->
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Double-check.</strong>&nbsp;You should now have Sass
              installed, but it never hurts to double-check. In your terminal
              application you can type: sass --version
            </p>
            <p>
              It should return something like:
              <code>1.14.1 compiled with dart2js 2.0.0</code>. Congratulations!
              You've successfully installed Sass.
            </p>

        </ul>
        <h2>CSSLint</h2>
        <p>From the CSSLint website:</p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            CSS Lint points out problems with your CSS code. It does basic

        <h2>Code Editor</h2>
        You will want to have a good code editor installed on your computer as
        well. If you haven't found one you really like yet I have a couple
        of&nbsp;recommendations:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS Code</a>
            (https://code.visualstudio.com/): Free, Mac/Windows/Linux, good
            general purpose editor with great Git support.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://brackets.io" target="_blank">Brackets</a>: This is
            an open source project run by Adobe. It excels with HTML/CSS/JS. It
            also has a strong following and many useful enhancements.
            Mac/PC/Linux - Free
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank">Atom</a>: This is another
            great open source project. It also has some very good plugins, and
            has great builtin git support. Not quite as strong for
            HTML/CSS&nbsp;as Brackets, but probably better for other languages.
