            If you are taking this course for the second time you should first:
            let the instructor know, and second: follow
            <a href="../modules/repeat-find-examples.html"
              >these instructions</a

            instead of completing the activity below. You will submit the work
            you do as you follow those instructions here.

          <p>
            At the beginning of a new semester it's always good to review what
            has gone before. Some of you may have been writing html last week,
            for others it may have been months ago. This activity is designed to
            help you 'brush out the cobwebs', so to speak, if any have had a
            chance to build up.
          </p>
          <p>
            This assignment is in part to help you assess your readiness for
            this course. If you struggle to remember the CSS necessary to
            complete this activity then you should plan on extra time each week
            as you remediate. All of the HTML and CSS knowledge you will need to
            complete this was introduced in WDD 130 and 230.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will provide the html for the activity to save you some time. I am
            most concerned with having you writing css as soon as possible. You
            should however <strong>carefully review</strong> the html file to
            make sure that you understand the purpose of every line in there.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>
          Refresh and demonstrate skills on media queries and make layouts with
          css. The layouts should match the mockups in a small browser window or
          larger browser window.

            rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >large screens</a
          >. The finished page should match the mockups in layout and styling,
          be responsive, and validate as html5 and css3. I would recommend
          building out the small screen first then adjusting for the large view.

        <h4>Details</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The font for the headlines is Lora and can be found on Google fonts.
          </li>
          <li>
            The font list for the body copy is: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif,
            and the color should be #333.
          </li>
          <li>You can use #d0d0d0 for the light grey color of the lines.</li>
          <li>
            Navigation links should behave thus: normal and visited: #666 and no
            underline , active: #DEB887, hover: #00ddff
          </li>
          <li>
            The exception would be the title of the site. It should be a link,
            but should not have a hover change and should remain the same color
            of the rest of the text (#333)
          </li>

          <li>
            You should be able to do this <strong>without</strong> modifying the
            html. Have that as your goal. If you do end up changing the .html
            file make sure to submit it with your css!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Achieving your goal of <strong>not</strong> modifying the html for
            this assignment will be easier if you remember that there are two
            ways to include an external font. The first would be to use a
            <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the html. That will obviously cause
            problems with our goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second is to use an <code>@import</code>
            <em>at the top of the css file</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google Fonts has the code for both on their site. I would use the
            <code>@import</code> method if I were you ;)
