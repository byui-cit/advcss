			<h1>Our story thus far...</h1>
           <div class="callout"><p>At the beginning of a new semester it's always good to review what has gone before.  Some of you may have been writing html last week, for others it may have been months ago.  This activity is designed to help you 'brush out the cobwebs', so to speak, if any have had a chance to build up. </p>
           
               <p>I will provide the html for the activity to save you some time.  I am most concerned with having you writing css as soon as possible.  You should however <strong>carefully review</strong> the html file to make sure that you understand the purpose of every line in there.</p>
    </div>
            <h2>Activity Directions</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Step 1:</span>&nbsp; Download the <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/review-webpage.html" target="_blank">html</a> for the page.  Then review the mockups for both <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/images/kidsread-sm.jpg" target="_blank">small</a> and <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/images/kidsread-lg.jpg" target="_blank">large screens</a>.  The finished page should match the mockups in layout and styling, be responsive, and validate as html5 and css3.  I would recommend building out the small screen first then adjusting for the large view.</p>
            
            <h4>Details</h4>
            <ul>
				<li>The font for the headlines is Lora and can be found on Google fonts</li>

				<li>The blue color is #6495ED.</li>

				<li>Article title links should behave thus: normal and visited: black and no underline , active: #DEB887, hover: #6495ED and underlined</li>

			</ul>
