			<h1>Selectors Review</h1>
          <hr />
           <p>Understanding selectors and their use is critical in being effective with CSS.  They form the backbone for everything we do.  You did some reading last week on selectors, this week we will enhance that with some additional resources, then follow it all up with a test.</p>
           <p>The resources listed below are for your benefit. Review as many of them as you feel you need to be confident in your ability to succeed at the exam. </p>
           <p>The exam is challenging, but most of it is multiple choice, I give you all the code that the questions are based off of, and you can use your editor. Make sure to plan enough time when you take the exam and you should do well.</p>
