			<h1>Create a Walkthrough</h1>
           
			<hr />
			<div class="callout">
			    <p>It's said that one of the best ways to learn something is to have to teach it.  This week you had the opportunity to learn about creating shapes with CSS. To help the concepts you were introduced to this week stick, I would like to give you the opportunity to teach someone else about them.  You need to create a walkthrough instructing how to create a specific shape with css and borders.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Activity</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Step 1</span>: &nbsp; Complete the <a href="l03-shapes-css.html" target="_blank">Shapes with CSS</a> activity then select a shape to base your walkthrough on. You might refer back to the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/" target="_blank">CSS-Tricks: Shapes of CSS</a> article.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 2</span>: &nbsp; Prepare your code and script for your walkthrough then create a screencast of you teaching the material you have prepared.  Post your screencast to the Class Discussion board.  If you don't have some screencast creation software that you already use I've had pretty good success with <a href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/home" target="_blank">Screencast-o-matic</a> </p>
			<h2>Grading</h2>
			<ul>
			    <li>Screencast shows understanding of the topic. (7pts)</li>
			    <li>Screencast includes clear examples.  (7pts)</li>
			    <li>Student narration is clear and understandable. (6pts)</li>
			</ul>
