        <h1>CSS Zen Garden Style Guide</h1>
        <hr />
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Two weeks ago you formed groups and picked a theme that you will use
            for your version of the CSS Zen Garden. You should have reviewed the
            content and prepared a couple of wireframes as well, making sure to
            include everything. This week we will continue our work on this
            project by preparing a styleguide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember the purpose of a styleguide is to decribe the color
            schemes, typography, branding, and styling for html elements for a
            site. If built correctly the css from the styleguide can be
            integrated directly into the css for the actual page when the time
            comes to build it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am actually going to provide you with a template to use for your
            styleguide. It is a slightly modified version of the
            <a
              href="https://codyhouse.co/gem/css-style-guide-template/"
              target="_blank"
              >Codyhouse Styleguide Template</a
            >.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 1</span>: &nbsp; Download the
          <a href="../resources/style-guide-template-parcel.zip">template</a>
          and unzip it. Take a few minutes to look at the directory structure
          that it uses.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will notice some simularities with the project we worked with last
          week. There is a <kbd>package.json</kbd> file, which means we will
          need to install the dependancies before we can use it. It uses Parcel
          as well, just like last week to act as our bundler. If you look inside
          of the <kbd>src</kbd> folder you will see the following:
        </p>
        <dl class="callout">
          <dt>assets</dt>
          <dd>This is where any images you need for the styleguide will go.</dd>
          <dt>css</dt>
          <dd>
            Directory for the final css files. Contains a reset.css and an
            initial styles.css that will be replaced.
          </dd>
          <dt>js</dt>
          <dd>
            We won't spend any time in here, but it contains some javascript
            that will generate parts of the style guide based on our styles.
            Check out main.js if you want to see what it does.
          </dd>
          <dt>scss</dt>
          <dd>
            This is where we will spend most of our time. It contains the .scss
            files we will use to define the styles for our styleguide.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
          This template uses SCSS which we learned about a couple of weeks ago.
          If you open up the styles.scss file and look at the first few lines
          you will see something that hopefully you will remember from your
          reading, but that we have not discussed yet: @import
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            In CSS @import gives us the ability to reference things in one css
            file from another. This is great, except for the fact that the files
            remain separate and so now what would have taken one http request to
            get now takes multiple. Not great.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sass @imports work similar to CSS imports: they allow us to break up
            our css into more managable parts, but they get compiled back into
            one file when we are done. We gain the organizational advantages
            without an increased load time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Breaking apart SCSS files into parts for organization happens so
            frequently in fact that there is a special type of SCSS file called
            a 'partial'. These files are never compiled on their own, but only
            included in other files. We indicate a partial with a leading
            underscore (_) on the file name.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          There are three partial files that are imported into the styles.scss.
          Two at the top and one at the bottom. You can find the actual files
          inside of scss/partials/. If you compile styles.scss into css you will
          see that the contents of those files do indeed get inserted in at the
          point where the @import command is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that the @import statements do not include the file extention
          as well. If one is not specified it will look for .scss
          <em>or</em> .sass
        </p>
        <p>
          Open the command line on your system and make sure you have the folder
          this project resides in open. Then type the following commands:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="bash">npm install</code></pre>
        <pre><code class="bash">npm run start</code></pre>
        <p>
          This will create a new directory, just like last week, called
          <kbd>build</kbd>. It will also launch a webserver you can see your
          project at as well.
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
          The other thing you might notice after compiling that scss into css is
          that the final styles.css file has almost 1000 lines! You might be
          thinking: "Isn't 1000 lines of css a bit overkill for a style guide
          template?" and the answer is: "Yes...yes it is."...but not only is
          this a template, it is also a good example of one way to organize a
          project ...something that many beginning developers struggle with.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 2</span>: &nbsp; Complete the styleguide
          by changing images, adding in the colors for your color scheme, the
          fonts you will use, and as many of the other styles that you have
          determined at this point. Feel free to remove any sections that you do
          not need (you won't have any forms or icons for example).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the styles you will be changing will be in the
          style-guide.scss file. As you define your styles lets take advantage
          of Sass partials to further organize things. Add a partial for each
          section that you complete in the style guide. Move any styles from
          style-guide.scss into the partial and add an @import. Any new styles
          that need to be defined should also be done in partials. You may even
          want to create a partial for all the variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          If done correctly this step will provide you with many of the styles
          you will need for your finished site in a form that will be easy to
          include in that site later.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Lets take a closer look at what I mean above. Typography is a common
            section in style guides...this one is no exception. You will notice
            that there is a section in the <code>style-guide.scss</code> labeled
            with comments as Typography...looks kind of like this:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="scss">
/* -------------------------------- 

xTypography 

-------------------------------- */

h1, h2 {
	font-family: $secondary-font;
	color: $color-2;
}

h1 {
	font-size: 2.4rem;
	font-weight: 300;
	line-height: 1.2;
	margin: 0 0 .4em;

	@include MQ(S) {
		font-size: 3.2rem;
	}

	@include MQ(M) {
		font-size: 4rem;
	}
}
...
        </code> </pre>
          <p>
            Lets take that whole section and place it into a partial. A good
            name might be something like <code>_typography.scss</code>. Then
            remove the code (I would leave the commented heading) from the
            <code>style-guide.scss</code> file and replace it with an
            <code>@import</code> statement.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could just as easily put that <code>@import</code> in another
            project to use these same typographical styles anywhere you needed.
            This is where SASS partials really begin to shine.
          </p>
          <p>Do this for each section you complete for the styleguide.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 3</span>: &nbsp; One member of the group
          should Compress/Archive the <kbd>src</kbd> directory of the completed
          style guide and upload it to ILearn to turn it in. Make sure to list
          all the names of the members of your group in the comments when you
          submit your style guide.
        </p>
