			<h1>Using CSS Grid</h1>
                        
			<hr />
			<div class="callout">
		<p>Grids and web design have a bit of a complicated history.  This is largely due to the fact that we keep using the same word to mean different things. For example designers have long used <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/grid-theory/" target="_blank">grid theory</a> to help in their designs. If you do a seach for "grid libraries" you will find a ton of tools that have been built in CSS (usually using float or flexbox) to help take your design based on grid theory and build it into a grid based layout.</p>
   <p>Recently the W3C finished the <a  href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/" target="_blank">CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1</a> specification and we are rapidly seeing <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=grid" target="_blank">browser support</a>. This specification is the second part of the layout solution web developers have been awaiting for many years.  We got the first with Flexbox...but flexbox really only shines with one dimensional layouts...either a row or column of content that may or may not wrap. Grid is the answer for layouts where X <em>and</em> Y position is critical.</p>	
   
    <p>Keep in mind that grid design theory, grid libraries, and the CSS Grid specification are different things even though they share similar names.  From here on when I refer to Grid...I mean the specification.</p>
    <p>Earlier this week we created a playing card front with flexbox, now we will do the same with Grid.</p>
    <p>You need to make sure that you are on a version of your browser that supports Grid.  Check the Caniuse link above to verify.</p>
    </div>
			<h2>Activity</h2>
			<p>For this activity we will continue with the flexbox based card created earlier in the week. We are going to enhance it so that if viewed in a browser that supports Grid, it will use Grid for the layout, otherwise it will use Flexbox.</p>
			
			<div class="callout">
			<h3>Resources</h3>
			<p >We will need some additional resources with knowledge about Grid and @supports to accomplish this task. Review the following:</p>
           <ul>
               <li><a href="https://gridbyexample.com" target="_blank">Grid By Example</a> Rachel Andrew's great tutorial site for Grid.</li>
               <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-css-grid-layout-module/" target="_blank">Introduction to the CSS Grid Layout Module</a> Sitepoint article </li>
               <li> <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" target="_blank">Complete Guide to Grid</a> CSS Tricks </li>
               <li> <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-css-supports-rule-feature-queries/" target="_blank">Introduction to CSS's @supports</a> Sitepoint Article</li>
           </ul>
            
            </div>
			
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Open your flexbox card pen in codepen.io.  Add a <code>@supports</code> block checking to see if the browser supports Grid. Add the SCSS you would need to redo your card with Grid.  (This means you will also need to undo some things.)</p>
			
			
    <p><span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; You may find it easier to take all of your flexbox based code and lock it up in a @supports(not()) block...have the Grid be the default, and the Flexbox used only if Grid isn't supported than the other way. That way you get to start with more of a clean slate with your Grid. </p>
			
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 03:</span>&nbsp; Submit the URL to your codepen to Ilearn.</p>
			
    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Card looks like a 7 of Clubs (or like a 7 of something). 10pts</li>
        <li>Card uses Grid in browsers that support it (@supports), and Flexbox in browsers that don't. 10pts</li>
        
        
    </ul>
