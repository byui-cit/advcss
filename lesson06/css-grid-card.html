          <p>
            Grids and web design have a bit of a complicated history. This is
            largely due to the fact that we keep using the same word to mean
            different things. For example designers have long used
            <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/grid-theory/" target="_blank"
              >grid theory</a
            >
            to help in their designs. If you do a seach for "grid libraries" you
            will find a ton of tools that have been built in CSS (usually using
            float or flexbox) to help take your design based on grid theory and
            build it into a grid based layout.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently the W3C finished the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/" target="_blank"
              >CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1</a
            >
            specification and we are rapidly seeing
            <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=grid" target="_blank"
              >browser support</a
            >. This specification is the second part of the layout solution web
            developers have been awaiting for many years. We got the first with
            Flexbox...but flexbox really only shines with one dimensional
            layouts...either a row or column of content that may or may not
            wrap. Grid is the answer for layouts where X <em>and</em> Y position
            is critical.
          </p>

          <p>
            Keep in mind that grid design theory, grid libraries, and the CSS
            Grid specification are different things even though they share
            similar names. From here on when I refer to Grid...I mean the
            specification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earlier this week we created a playing card front with flexbox, now
            we will do the same with Grid.
          </p>
          <p>
            You need to make sure that you are on a version of your browser that
            supports Grid. Check the Caniuse link above to verify.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>
          For this activity we will continue with the flexbox based card created
          earlier in the week. We are going to enhance it so that if viewed in a
          browser that supports Grid, it will use Grid for the layout, otherwise
          it will use Flexbox.

          <h3>Resources</h3>
          <p>
            We will need some additional resources with knowledge about Grid and
            @supports to accomplish this task. Review the following:

              Rachel Andrew's great tutorial site for Grid. I would recommend as
              a start to watch:

        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Open your flexbox card
          pen in codepen.io. Add a <code>@supports</code> block checking to see
          if the browser supports Grid. Add the SCSS you would need to redo your
          card with Grid. (This means you will also need to undo some things.)
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            You may find it easier to take all of your flexbox based code and
            lock it up in a @supports not() {} block...have the Grid be the
            default, and the Flexbox used only if Grid isn't supported than the
            other way. That way you get to start with more of a clean slate with
            your Grid.
          </p>
          <p>Your supports block will probably look something like this:</p>
          <pre><code class="scss">
@supports not (display: grid) {
    All of your flexbox SCSS code here.            
}  </code></pre>
          <p>
            @supports works very similarly to @media. Both take a condition and
            the css in the block associated with them is run if the condition is
            true. Like @media, you need to make sure that you have the default
            css styles <em>before</em> the @supports block in your file.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; Create a CSS Grid based
          layout for your card. Your grid will work best if all of the pips on
          the card share a common parent. Grid is similar to Flexbox in that
          when you turn on grid for an element...it only effects the immediate
          children of that element.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 03:</span>&nbsp; Remove the "not" from
          the @supports block to test that you did not break your Flexbox layout
          while making your Grid one. Replace the "not" and submit the URL to
          your codepen to Ilearn.

          <li>
            Card uses Grid in browsers that support it (@supports), and Flexbox
