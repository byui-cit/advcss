			<h1>Using grid layout systems</h1>
                        
			<hr />
			<div class="callout">
			
    <p>If you do any looking on the web, you will quickly find that designing to a grid has become very popular.  As a result there are a lot of css libraries created to help you build the web pages that you have designed with your grid.  Earlier this week we took a look at flexbox and solving a particular problem with it. Now we get to solve it again...but this time with a grid system/library. </p>
    <p>If you do a search for "css grid library" you will be overwhelmed with choices. (Do not confuse this with the CSS grid specification that I mentioned briefly in the last assignment they share similar names...but are <strong>not</strong> the same.) It seems everyone has taken a stab at solving this particular problem in their own way.  Most of them work very similarly however, and learning to use one makes it pretty straightforward to pick up another later.</p>
    </div>
			<h2>Activity</h2>
			<p>For this activity we will be using a flexbox based grid system called <a href="http://flexboxgrid.com" target="_blank">Flexbox Grid</a>. We will be creating the same card (a 7 of clubs) that we created in the Flexbox assignment. As you complete this pay attention to the similarities and differences between the 2 approaches.</p>
			<div class="callout">
			<p >The link I provided above has the download button front and center.  There is also an online CDN (content delivery network) version you can use as well.  This makes it convenient if you want to use a service like codepen to do your work. </p>
            <p>To allow an external css file to work in codepen you will need to goto the css settings (Little gear icon next to the CSS section) then under the "Add External CSS" section paste the following:</p>
            <pre><code class="html">https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/flexboxgrid/6.3.0/flexboxgrid.min.css</code></pre>
            <p>After adding that you will be able to use all the css from the library.</p>
            </div>
			<h3>Tips and Guidelines</h3>
			<ul>
			    <li>You should be able to reuse some of the classes from the flexbox assignment for this one. For example the classes that form the card outline, and size and color the symbols should stay the same.</li>
			    <li>Most Grid systems (including Flexbox Grid) use a 12 column grid.  This is not ideal for a playing card...but with a little creativity you can make it work.</li>
			    <li>Just like with the flexbox assignment you will need to decide how many rows you will use. I have successfully completed this with everything in one row <strong>and</strong> each row on the card in a separate &lt;div class="row"&gt; as well.  Each has different challenges.</li>
                <li>You will probably want to read the documentation...no really...<strong>read the docs</strong> and look over the examples ;) </li>
			    <li>Just like last week don't stress about making your html card look <em>exactly</em> like whatever 7 of clubs you are looking at.  As long as it looks good and is balanced and has all the elements you will get credit. (Don't worry about the half rows many cards use for example)</li>
			    <li>Finally don't be afraid to look at the actual css for the library.  You can see how they did everything! Sometimes this can help you to understand why it is doing (or not doing) something.</li>
			    
			</ul>
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Create a new pen in codepen.io.  Make sure to change the css settings to use SCSS so you can take advantage of Sass and add in the Flexbox Grid external link (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/flexboxgrid/6.3.0/flexboxgrid.min.css). You should be able to use the same classes and much of the html structure you created for the Flexbox assignment to create the general shape of the card.</p>
			
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; Apply the correct classes from the Flexbox Grid library to make your card layout match the correct layout for a 7 of Clubs. You should not need to write much css yourself, but you may need to make some minor adjustments after you have the bulk of the layout done to get it right.</p>
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 03:</span>&nbsp; Submit the URL to your codepen to Ilearn.</p>
			
    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flexbox Grid library used with minimal additional css to create the 7 of Clubs. 15pts</li>
        
        
    </ul>
