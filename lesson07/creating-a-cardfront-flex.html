        <h2>CSS Layout</h2>
                
            <h2>Adding Wider Support</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Hopefully your Grid layout came together easily and you are
              beginning to understand the power behind this specification. While
              it has pretty good support, there are still a lot of older
              browsers that do not support it yet. You should always have a
              fallback plan with your sites, especially when using newer
              features.
            </p>
            <p>This week we will take our CSS Grid based card from <a href="../lesson06/creating-a-cardfront-grid.html" target="_blank">Part 1 of this activity</a> and using some conditional CSS magic provided by <code>@supports</code> we will re-create our layout using flexbox for those browsers that do not support grid.</p>

            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Working with <code>@supports</code></h3>
            <p>
              Open your Grid card pen in codepen.io. Add a
              <code>@supports not {}</code> block checking to see if the browser
              does not support Grid. Add the SCSS you would need to rebuild your
              card with Flexbox.
            </p>

            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                While building, if you are in a browser that does support Grid
                you may have a hard time seeing your Flex layout to make sure it
                is right. You may find it easier to check if Grid is supported
                for testing, then switch it to a not supported at the end.
              </p>
              <p>
                Initially (while building and testing) your supports block will
                probably look something like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="scss">
@supports (display: grid) {
	// All of your flexbox SCSS code here.            
}  </code></pre>
              <p>Before you turn it in however change it to:</p>
              <pre><code class="scss">
@supports not (display: grid) {
	// All of your flexbox SCSS code here.            
}  </code></pre>
              <p>
                @supports works very similarly to @media. Both take a condition
                and the css in the block associated with them is run if the
                condition is true. Like @media, you need to make sure that you
                have the default css styles <em>before</em> the @supports block
                in your file.
              </p>

          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Flex based layout</h3>
            <p>
              Create a Flexbox based layout for your card. You should try to not
              add any additional HTML markup to your card. Doing so will most
              likely break your Grid layout.
            </p>
            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Verify and Submit</h3>
            <p>
              Remove the "not" from the @supports block to test that you did not
              break your Grid layout while making your Flexbox one. Submit the
              URL to your codepen to Ilearn.
            </p>

            Card uses Grid in browsers that support it (@supports), and Flexbox
            in browsers that don't. 10pts
          </li>
          <li>
              Card looks very similar in both Grid and flexbox. 10pts
