        <h1>Building a Simple Component</h1>

        <hr />
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Websites are often just collections of pieces called components.
            Treating them this way helps us to write more re-usable code. It
            also can help reduce the complexity of redesigns. We will read and
            discuss this more next week. This week however I would like you to
            produce the HTML and CSS for a simple web component.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Review the layout.</h3>
            <p>
              Below is a screenshot of the component we would like to build. It
              is a simple shopping cart. Review it considering how the HTML
              should be structured, and how you might layout the different
              elements.
            </p>
            <div class="fig-block">
              <figure>
                <img src="../images/cart.png" alt="simple shopping cart" />
              </figure>
            </div>
            <!-- Step End -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Write the HTML</h3>
            <p>
              Create a new Codepen and write the HTML.  Keep in mind semantics as you choose the elements to represent each part of the cart. Also keep in mind how you should structure things to make your layouts work. i.e. if you are using Flexbox or Grid do all of the right elements share a common parent?, etc.
            </p>
            <!-- Step End -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Style</h3>
            <p>
              Add your SCSS now to replicate the screenshot as closely as possible. Pay attention to padding, margins, font-sizes, placement, etc.  You can just use <kbd>helvetica, arial, san-serif</kbd> for the font.
            </p>
            <!-- Step End -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Submit in Ilearn</h3>
            <p>
              Submit the codepen url to Ilearn.
            </p>
            <!-- Step End -->
          </li>
        </ol>
