    <p>We've now looked at 3 different ways to build the layout for a playing card now, and you may be saying to yourself: "Cards are great and all, but what does this have to do with making websites?". Lets take a look. </p>
    
    </div>
			
			<p>Here is the card we have been playing with over the last 2 weeks.</p>
			<div class="fig-block">
			        <figure>
			            <img src="../images/7-clubs.png" alt="image of a 7 of clubs playing card">
			         </figure>
			    </div>
			
			<p>If you squint at it a bit you might be able to see the content areas we have created...if you can look past the pips. I drew some boxes on it to help with this.</p>
			<div class="fig-block">
			        <figure>
			            <img src="../images/7-clubs-as-layout1.png" alt="image of a 7 of clubs playing card with boxes">
			         </figure>
			    </div>
			
			
			<p>If you squint even harder did any of you see this: </p>
               <div class="fig-block">
			        <figure>
			            <img src="../images/7-clubs-as-layout2.png" alt="image of a 7 of clubs playing card as a page layout">
			         </figure>
			    </div>
    <p>That to me looks a lot like the layout of a webpage.</p>
               <p>Top row: logo and left and right aligned navigation bars.</p>
                <p>2nd row full width banner.</p>
                <p>3rd and 4th rows content boxes.</p>
                
		<h2>Activity</h2>			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 1:</span> Take a few minutes and think about the other cards...what kinds of layouts could you create with them...can you find examples any of the ones you thought of in the wild? Share what you discovered with your classmates. </p>
