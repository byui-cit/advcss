			<h1>Choose Your Own Adventure.</h1>
                        
			<hr />
			<div class="callout">
			
    <p>When I was younger there was a popular series of books called "Choose Your own Adventure".  You got to make choices about what would happen next and direct the story. Each person reading it could have a totally different experience. Not only that, but you could come back later, read it again and make different choices. It was like a whole new book each time through. Not sure if they are still around... </p>
    <p>We read a lot about choosing in the scriptures as well. One of the first things Adam was told was "...nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee..." <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/3?lang=eng" target="_blank">Moses 3:17</a>, and then he was taught about consequences.  Jacob also taught us that "...ye are free to act for yourselves--to choose..." <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10?lang=eng" target="_blank">2 Nephi 10:23</a>.  In our education too often our only choice is whether we are going to do our homework, or maybe whether to participate in class or not. </p>
    <p>The thing is, we are all at different places in our knowledge and skills...and we have different goals and interests as well.  This week I'm giving you the opportunity to direct your experience in the class by making a few choices of your own.  I want you to choose some aspect of css layouts or responsive design that has been troubling you or you want to understand better and master it.</p>

			<h2>Activity</h2>
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Begin this activity by choosing a problem or topic.  Here are a few ideas for inspiration if you don't have something in mind yet: </p>
			<ul>
			    <li>Pay attention to any websites that you visit.  Are any of them using a layout or responsive technique that you find interesting or confusing?  </li>
			    <li>Think about your plans for your version of the CSS Zen Garden.  Does it require any layout or responsive techniques that you are unsure how to accomplish?</li>
                <li>Goto the <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/topics/all?q=&limit=24&offset=0&page=1&content_types[]=All&slugs[]=all&states[]=available&order=" target="_blank">library page on Sitepoint</a> and search "responsive"  Pick one of the courses or screencasts that looks interesting and check it out. </li>
                <li>Are you comfortable making any html element responsive? Think carefully about what you would do with these: images (foreground or background, retina or not), forms, tables, videos, navigation.  If there is one you are not sure what you would do with...study it! (See if you can find a specific example in a blog or on a site such as codepen).</li>
                <li>Concerned about your ability to layout creative designs in css?  Take a newsletter, flyer, poster, magazine page, or some other document with an interesting layout and reproduce it in html and css.</li>
                <li>Stay Focused! Your task is not to answer <strong>all</strong> your responsive/layout questions...just <strong>one</strong> of them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you have chosen your topic, outline it for the assignment.  This should be a detailed description of the problem and how you will solve it, along with a screenshot if helpful.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; Do whatever research is required, then build an example of the technique you are trying to master. Your example can take the form of a pen on codepen, a collection of files (html/css/scss) zipped up, or a link to the example on a host.  Submit your example to ILearn. </p>

			<h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Problem/Goal is clearly defined and related to responsive design. 5pts</li>
        <li>Example given is a complete solution to the stated problem 10pts</li>
        
        
    </ul>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Lets say that I had recently seen a website that had a responsive banner with video playing in the background, and some information in the foreground.  It looked cool and I wondered how they did it.  I inspected their code and started getting an idea how they had done it, but it was a bit messy and hard to follow...so I decided to see if there was another resource demonstrating how to accomplish the same affect.</p>
    <p>I have access this semester to all the resources on Sitepoint so I did a search for "responsive video" and one of the results was <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/screencasts/web-elements-with-responsive-background-videos" target="_blank">Web Elements with Responsive Background Videos</a>, a five minute screencast. Perfect! </p>
       <p>I watched the screencast, then found a video of my own to practice with and created my own page from scratch to make sure I really understood how to do it.</p>
