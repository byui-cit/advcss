			<h1>Create your own grid</h1>
                        
			<hr />
			<div class="callout">
			
    <p>Last week we looked at 2 different ways to build the layout for a playing card.  Once from scratch, and once using a grid system library.  While building the card layout you probably noticed that the library we were using was not ideally suited for the task we had.</p>
    <p>  Funny enough this is often the case, even when we are not building something as specific as a seven of clubs.  The reason there are so many grid systems out there is that they are <em>never</em> perfect for <em>every</em> task.  It is not uncommon to have to crack open the hood, so to speak, and tinker. This week I would like to build on what you learned in the 2 activities from last week to create our own specialized grid library.</p>
    </div>
			<h2>Activity</h2>
			<p>This activity will have you create a css grid library. To keep the scope reasonable we are going to build a specialized library that will be used for a specific purpose: to layout and build playing card fronts.</p>
			<p class="callout">In other assignments I have provided html for you to style that you were not allowed to change.  In this case I should be able to take your .scss and using only the classes you provide in your library I should be able to write the html to build any card from A-10 <em>without changing any css</em>!</p>
			<h3>Based on what we learned last week here are a few guidlines and tips we will follow:</h3>
			<ul>
			    <li>A typical playing card has a height that is 1.4 times it's width.</li>
			    <li>Our library should use flexbox for positioning.</li>
			    <li>One of the first (and arguably most important) decisions we will need to make is how many columns we should have in the grid.</li>
			    <li>We will probably need to create a class to create a row in your grid, and then classes to create 1 column, 2 columns, etc.</li>
			    <li>Classes to create offsets (skipping columns) would probably also be helpful.</li>
			    <li>For the suits we will use svg.  I still have an example file with the <a href="../resources/svg-card-suits.html" target="_blank">svg suit shapes</a> in it to start with.</li>
			    <li>You can learn a lot about grids by poking around in an existing grid framework to see how they solved certain problems.  Make sure the one you look at uses flexbox and not floats or inline-block however.</li>
			    
			</ul>
	
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Create a new pen in codepen.io.  Make sure to change the css settings to use SCSS so you can take advantage of Sass. You should be able to use the same classes you created last week for the card backs to create the general shape of the card. Choose a card to start with (I recommend 5, 7, or 10) and add all the elements you will need.</p>
			<div class="callout">
			    <p>For example if I were making the 5 of clubs which looks something like this: </p>
			    <div class="fig-block">
			        <figure>
			            <img src="../images/5-clubs.png" alt="image of a 5 of clubs playing card">
			         </figure>
			    </div>
			    <p>I would need a number and small suit, then 5 regular sized suits, then another 5 and small suit. Notice that some of those icons are upside down! Try this class to make that happen: </p>
			    <pre><code class="css">
.rotate {
    transform: rotate(180deg);
}			        
			    </code></pre>
			</div>
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; Create the rest of the classes you will need to make your card look right. Then create a second different card to test your library.  Hopefully you won't need to make any changes to your css to get it to work, but make adjustments as necessary. Once the first and second card are correct try as many others as you need to feel comfortable that your library will work for <strong>any</strong> card A-10.  (Don't forget to try the Ace ;) )</p>
					<div class="callout">
			    <p>Because most of you have probably not had the experience of building something with a grid I will provide a bit of html to use to get you started.  Your final HTML does <strong>not</strong> have to look just like this.  It is merely an example of a direction you could take to get you started</p>
			    <p>For my example you can see that I chose to use SVG symbols.</p>

&lt;!-- Example of html structure for a card--&gt;
&lt;div class="card card-front"&gt;

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Grid library can be used to create any playing card A-10 by changing the html markup but <strong>without</strong> changing the css. 10pts</li>
        <li>SCSS has been used where appropriate. (variables for colors or sizes would be a good start) 4pts</li>
        <li>Grid is Flexbox based. 6pts</li>
        
    </ul>
