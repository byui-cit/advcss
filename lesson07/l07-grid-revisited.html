			<h1>Optimize your grid</h1>
                        
			<hr />
			<div class="callout">
			
    <p>Making a layout for a specific design can be challenging, after last week you have probably seen that making a library that will work in a wider variety of situations is even trickier.  We made a grid that would work for one purpose...creating a playing card.  This week I want to spend a few minutes to see if there are things we could do to make our code useful in a wider variety of situations.</p>
    </div>
			<h2>Activity</h2>
			<p class="callout">This activity will have you continue working with the css grid library you created last week. For my examples I will be using the code that I came up with...it's ok if your code is different from mine.  As the old saying goes...there is more than one way to skin a cat :)</p>
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Create a new pen in codepen.io.  Make sure to change the css settings to use SCSS so you can take advantage of Sass. You should be able to use the same classes you created last week for the card backs to create the general shape of the card. Choose a card to start with (I recommend 5, 7, or 10) and add all the elements you will need.</p>
			<div class="callout">
			    <p>For example if I were making the 5 of clubs which looks something like this: </p>
			    <div class="fig-block">
			        <figure>
			            <img src="../images/5-clubs.png" alt="image of a 5 of clubs playing card">
			         </figure>
			    </div>
			    <p>Move @media mixin from week 4 getting started to here.  Create a different mixin to illustrate concepts in week 4? </p>
			    <pre><code class="css">
.rotate {
    transform: rotate(180deg);
}			        
			    </code></pre>
			</div>
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; Create the rest of the classes you will need to make your card look right. Then create a second different card to test your library.  Hopefully you won't need to make any changes to your css to get it to work, but make adjustments as necessary. Once the first and second card are correct try as many others as you need to feel comfortable that your library will work for <strong>any</strong> card A-10.  (Don't forget to try the Ace ;) )</p>
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 03:</span>&nbsp; Submit the URL to your codepen to Ilearn.</p>
			
    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Grid library can be used to create any playing card A-10 by changing the html markup but <strong>without</strong> changing the css. 10pts</li>
        <li>SCSS has been used where appropriate. (variables for colors or sizes would be a good start) 4pts</li>
        <li>Grid is Flexbox based. 6pts</li>
        
    </ul>
