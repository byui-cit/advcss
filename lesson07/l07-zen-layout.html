			<h1>Zen Garden Layout</h1>
                        
			<hr />
			<div class="callout">
			
    <p>It's time to revisit our group project. Hopefully you have been thinking about it. You have chosen a theme, and should have worked up some wireframes.  this week lets apply what we have learned about CSS and create the layout for your project.</p>
    
    </div>
			<h2>Activity</h2>
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Begin this activity by reviewing your theme and wireframes for your Zen Garden project with your group. Discuss what method of CSS layout makes the most sense for what you want to accomplish. There is no one answer to this. You should keep a few things in mind though as you discuss: </p>
			<ul>
			    <li>We have talked a lot about Flexbox, and I am a big fan, but it is not always the best answer.  Make sure that you evaluate each method that you know for css layout and discuss advantages and disadvantages.  </li>
			    <li>Remember that your final site should be responsive.  You should have addressed this already with your wireframes...thinking about how your page will respond can sometimes help you to determine the best layout method.</li>
                <li>Also remember that most sites come together better if you start mobile first.  Build your mobile layout first, then add the changes in with media queries to adapt it to the larger screen sizes.</li>
                <li><b>Your job is not to finish your site this week!</b>  It will still look rough, but each section should be in the right position related to the other sections. You will have a lot of work to do after this with details. </li>
                <li>Finally remember that you cannot modify the HTML for this project.  You may have to get creative with your selectors.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; Complete the layout with your group and submit your css file and wireframe files (large and small screen) to Ilearn.</p>

			<h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Layout matches the wireframes. 10pts</li>
        <li>Layout is responsive 10pts</li>
        
        
    </ul>
