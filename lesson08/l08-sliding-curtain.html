                <p>Hard to believe I know, but animations and transitions can be used for more than creating card tricks :)  If you start paying attention you will begin to see them all over the place.  The best are quite subtle.  One area I am seeing a lot of them currently is in menus.  It can make the appearance and disappearance of a menu much more pleasing to not have them pop in and out suddenly. Another current trend is <a href="https://codyhouse.co/demo/full-page-intro-and-navigation/index.html" target="_blank">full screen overlay menus</a>.  </p>
                <p>Effects such as that require a few different techniques.  You need to know how to make something take up 100% of the width and height of the viewport, you need to understand layering, triggering an event on a click, moving stuff around, and transitions to smooth it all out.</p>

			<h2>Activity</h2>
			<p>As we have discussed before one of the skills that will be the most valuable for you to devlop during this course (and others) is the ability to read and understand code examples from others. For this activity you complete a tutorial that will teach us several of the effects above.  </p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; The tutorial we will be completing for this activity is: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/creating-css-sliding-door-effect/" target="_blank">Creating a sliding door effect</a> on CSS Tricks. Create a new codepen and complete the tutorial. Include comments throughout the html and css to show that you understand what each section is doing. </p>
			<div class="callout">
			    <p>The amount of benefit you receive from this activity will vary greatly based on how much effort you put into it to <em>understanding</em> what is going on instead of just focusing on getting it done. </p>
			    <p>One way to tell if you have really grasped the concepts would be to try and modify it to work differently.  Try for example to change it to work opposite of what it does now...have the background shown initially, and when something is clicked have it show...or maybe have only one side show.  If you can do that you are halfway to making a menu that slides out from the side...</p>
			</div>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; Submit the codepen with your functioning curtain effect to ILearn.</p>
