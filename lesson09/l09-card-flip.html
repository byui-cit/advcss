			<h1>Card Flip</h1>
                        
			<hr />
			<div class="callout">
			<p>You are probably getting a little tired of cards at this point.  Well good news! This is the last week we will be working with them.  We have everything we need now for a complete card, all that is left is to put all the pieces together. That is this weeks task.</p>
    
    
    </div>
			<h2>Activity</h2>
			<p>For this activity you will build a completed card by utilizing the parts we have created over the last few weeks and CSS transforms. When the page loads you should see one card with the face down. When you hover (or click) on the card it should flip over to expose the face.  Then the face should change into another card (last weeks assignment). </p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Create a new codepen and combine your favorite card back from week 5 with the card face you used last week for your trick. You will want them stacked on top of each other with the back showing.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; Apply a CSS transform that will flip the back and front around.  Once finished you should not be able to see the back, only the front.  Your transitions or animations from week 8 should play after the flip is done. </p>
			<h3>Tips</h3>
			<ul>
			    <li>You will first need to group the card front and back in a div. The width/height for your card should be set at this parent, the other styling for the card (rounded corners, shadow, etc) should be applied to the front or back containers.</li>
			    <li>If have no idea where to start for this...take a look at <code>transform: rotateY()</code>.  You may also want to take a look at something like this <a href="http://callmenick.com/post/css-transitions-transforms-animations-flipping-card" target="_blank">tutorial on flipping a card</a></li>
                <li>You will need to position the card front and back on top of each other. Remember to set <code>position: relative</code> on the parent that contains the front and back.</li>
                <li>Get the flip working correctly before you work on the change from one card to another.  You may have to tweak some of your triggers to get it to work correctly. </li>
                
                
			</ul>
