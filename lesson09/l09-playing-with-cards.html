			<h1>Playing with Cards</h1>

			<p>As we learn new things we tend to draw parallels to other things that we are already familiar with. If you have read the chapter in <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-1/" target="_blank">Atomic Design</a> that was in the list for this week it talks about how that happened in web design.  The concept of page is definitely everywhere.  Other concepts have been introduced due to the way that most of us learned to use the web...and the way it was presented to us.  "Click Here" for example used to be everywhere, and it made sense because that's how most people were interacting with the web...with a mouse and by clicking.</p>
			<div>That is changing however as we add more and more ways to interface with the web, in fact many people do way more tapping than clicking these days, I wonder how long it will be before we see a 'Tap Here' link.  These new devices are forcing a change in thinking about how to design for the web that you will all be heavily involved in.  Every year new ways to interact are introduced, and so we need new metaphors.</div>
    
    
    </div>
			<h2>Activity</h2>
			<p>The first activity for this week had you use transforms to flip a card.  This activity has us continue by thinking about what else we can do with a card, and how those might be used in a web interface. </p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Find a piece of paper, an index card would work especially well.  Holding it think about all of the different things you can do with it.  Make a list. Spend several minutes on this.  Review your list and think about how those actions might translate into a web interface and what you might use them for.  </p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; Choose two actions from your list that you thought of good use cases for (and that you think you can actually implement) and using transitions, animations, and transforms implement them as a codepen. </p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 03:</span>&nbsp; Submit the url to your codepen to Ilearn. Add your list of actions as well as a comment. </p>
