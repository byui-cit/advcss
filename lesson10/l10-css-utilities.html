			<h1>CSS Utilities</h1>

			<div class="callout">
			<p>As our websites and the code that creates them becomes more and more complex, it becomes more and more difficult to spot and fix problems that might arise. Developers combat this with a combination of organizational best practices that are designed to reduce error, and tools and utilities that can help locate and fix problems when they occur. </p>
			<div>At the beginning of the semester you were asked to install several utilities in fact, many of which we haven't discussed yet.  You have been learning about organization through your readings, lets take a few minutes and explore those tools.</div>
    
    
    </div>
			<h2>Activity</h2>
			<p>The first activity for this week had you use transforms to flip a card.  This activity has us continue by thinking about what else we can do with a card, and how those might be used in a web interface. </p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Find a piece of paper, an index card would work especially well.  Holding it think about all of the different things you can do with it.  Make a list. Spend several minutes on this.  Review your list and think about how those actions might translate into a web interface and what you might use them for.  </p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; Choose two actions from your list that you thought of good use cases for (and that you think you can actually implement) and using transitions, animations, and transforms implement them as a codepen. </p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 03:</span>&nbsp; Submit the url to your codepen to Ilearn. Add your list of actions as well as a comment. </p>
