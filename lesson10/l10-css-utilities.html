        <h1>CSS Utilities</h1>

        <hr />
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            At the beginning of the semester you were asked to install several
            utilities in fact, many of which we haven't discussed yet. Lets do
            that now. You have been learning about organization and debugging
            this week through your readings, lets take a few minutes and explore
            those tools to see how they might help with those goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            This will put us back at the command line typing in commands...you
            may need to review the
            <a href="../resources/cmd-line-mac.html" target="_blank"
              >command line mac</a
            >
            or
            <a href="../resources/cmd-line-pc.html" target="_blank"
              >command line pc</a
            >
            resources. You will need to be comfortable changing directories to
            succeed with this activity.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>
          Make sure to have
          <a
            href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/css-master-2nd-edition/read/2"
            target="_blank"
            >CSS Master: Ch2. Debugging and Optimization</a
          >
          open to refer to during this activity. It has usage instructions for
          some of the utilities we will be looking at here.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Open up the command line
          on your computer (Run->cmd on the pc and Terminal on the Mac). Change
          to a directory where you have a css file you have written and follow
          the directions in CSS Mastery to run the <kbd>stylelint</kbd> utility
          on the file. How many errors did you have? Try outputting the errors
          to a file using this syntax:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">stylelint stylesheet.css > csslintoutput.txt</code></pre>
        <p>
          Practice interpreting the error messages by fixing them until the test
          comes back clean.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Linters have become quite popular not just with CSS, but also HTML
            and Javascript. One thing to understand however is that they are
            <strong>not</strong> validators. They will find some errors, but
            they are more concerned with helping you write clean optimized,
            readable code. They tend to be very opinionated as a result. They
            don't just encourage you to write valid code, but
            <em>correct</em> code by avoiding bad practices...according to
            whomever setup the rules of the Linter.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may or may not agree with all these opinions however, and so
            most Linting packages are configurable...you can use your own
            opinions instead of someone else's. Instructions on how to modify
            CSSLints defaults can be found at
            <a href="http://csslint.net" target="_blank">CSSLint.net</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; The next tool we will
          use is Analyze-Css. With the same CSS file as the last step run the
          analyze-css utility according to the instructions in CSS Master Ch3.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Try running each of these utilities without any arguments...just
            type the command. You should see some hints on how to use the
            command. This is pretty typical for these type of utilities and
            learning how to read this type of concise help is a good skill to
            develop.
          </p>
          <p>
            if you run it for analyze-css for example you will see something
            like this:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="bash">
analyze-css --url &lt;url&gt; [options]

Options:
  --url                Set URL of CSS to analyze                                            
  --file               Set local CSS file to analyze                                        
  --ignore-ssl-errors  Ignores SSL errors, such as expired or self-signed certificate errors
  --pretty, -p         Causes JSON with the results to be pretty-printed                    
  --no-offenders, -N   Show only the metrics without the offenders part                     
  --auth-user          Sets the user name used for HTTP authentication                      
  --auth-pass          Sets the password used for HTTP authentication                       
  --version, -V        Show version number and quit                                         
  --help, -h           This help text           
			    </code> </pre>
          <p>
            There are certain conventions that are almost always followed with
            these helps. Here are a few of the more common conventions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Things written in ALLCAPS or in <strong>bold</strong> often means
              type it <em>exactly</em> as it appears,
            </li>
            <li>
              and lowercase, <em>italics</em>, or surrounded with &lt; &gt; can
              mean you are supposed to change it to something specific.
            </li>
            <li>
              Something surrounded in [ ] is going to be an optional part of the
              command. It will work with our without that part.
            </li>
            <li>
              A | (pipe) between two parameters means that you can use one or
              the other, but not both.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The instructions from the book say to type something like this:</p>
          <pre><code class="bash">analyze-css --file filename.css</code> </pre>
          <p>
            The results are not very readable however. How would you modify the
            command to give better output?
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Most of what Analyze-css gives back is informational. It tells you how
          many selectors you are using, how specific they are (less specific is
          usually better), if you are using any prefixed css that you don't need
          to anymore, and then it will point out offenders and
          duplicates...selectors that you really should look at and optimize.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 03:</span>&nbsp; Finally run the uncss
          utility on your file. It is a great optimization tool. It looks at
          your css and finds any rules that were not used...then removes them!
          Try this for example. Take a look at the CSS for the
          <a href="../resources/foundation.css" target="_blank"
            >Foundation css framework</a
          >. Then take a look at this simple
          <a href="../resources/foundation-all.html" target="_blank"
            >example page</a
          >
          that has the Foundation css linked in. Now run Uncss on it.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="bash">
    uncss http://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/foundation-all.html
                   </code> </pre>
        You may even want to send the results to a file like this:
        <pre><code class="bash">
    uncss http://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/foundation-all.html > optimized.css
                   </code> </pre>
        <p>What was the result?</p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 04:</span>&nbsp; Submit your output file
          of errors from CSSLint in step 1, and the optimzed css file you got
          from step 3 to ILearn.
        </p>
