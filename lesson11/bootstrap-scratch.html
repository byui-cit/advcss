            <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>
            advertises itself as the "world's most popular front-end component
            library". I can't speak to the veracity of that statement, but I do
            know it <em>is</em> pretty cool.
          </p>
          <p>
            A framework is really just a collection of code (in this case html,
            css, and javascript) and design patterns that solve common design
            problems. Bootstrap is no exception. It started out as a styleguide
            for Twitter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most projects have the same core set of issues that have to be
            addressed. One huge advantage of css frameworks (or any framework
            for that matter) is that they have solutions pre-built and more
            importantly very well tested to those core problems. Thus they can
            save developers a lot of time.
          </p>

        <h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
        <p>
          There are several utilities you will need to make sure are working on
          your computer for the install to go smoothly. If you followed the
          <a href="../lesson01/l01-software.html" target="_blank"
            >software setup instructions</a
          >
          you should be most of the way there. Here is a list of things to
          verify. Open a command line window and try the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure that Node is installed and that you have the correct
            version by entering:
            <pre><code class="bash">node -v</code></pre>
            You should see a version number. That version should start with
            14.x.x or 16.x.x. If you get any errors or "command not found" try
            running through the
            <a href="../lesson01/l01-software.html" target="_blank"
              >software setup instructions</a
            >
            again.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have not spent much time in the command line of your
            operating system you should review
            <a
              href="https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/cli-basics/"
              >CLI Basics</a
            >

          <!-- <li>
            Install Yarn (a javascript package manager) by entering

            .
          </li> -->
        </ul>

          If you run into any issues get some help from a fellow student or the
          instructor.

        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>
          Bootstrap gives several options for use. The simplest would be to
          simply download the full, compiled CSS file, and link it into your
          html normally. This is a great option to get up and going quickly, but
          is not really great for production. Most sites will not use all of
          what Bootstrap offers and so downloading the full CSS is overkill.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next option would be to take advantage a CDN (content delivery
          network). This is a server optimized for speed that has one
          job...serve up libraries. Bootstrap's CDN can be included by adding
          the following lines to your html
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </code></pre>

        <p>
          Bootstrap can also be quickly integrated into a codepen. If you click
          on the CSS setting (gear icon next to CSS) then scroll down to the
          "Add External CSS section" you will see a drop down labeled
          "Quick-add". Bootstrap is one of the options there. This can let you
          quickly try something out.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best option however is to take advantage of Bootstrap's Sass
          version. The rest of this activity will have us install Bootstrap into
          a project with a professional style workflow. We will be roughly
          following the
          <a
            href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/parcel/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >instructions in the Bootstrap documentation</a
          >
        </p>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Create a folder on your computer called <kbd>parcel</kbd>. Open that
          folder in your editor (this activity will be easier if you are using
          VS Code as your editor). If you are not using VS Code I would
          recommend creating this folder on your Desktop so it will be easier to
          find.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are using VS Code as your editor you can open the terminal in
          your open project (ctrl + ~) and it will automatically set the working
          directory to the open project folder. If you are using some other
          editor, Open your command line prompt on your computer and navigate to
          the directory containing the downloaded code. Mac and Windows should
          start you in your user directory when you open a new command prompt.
          Or you can type:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mac:
            <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd ~</code></pre>
            (tilde) or
          </li>
          <li>
            Windows:
            <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd %userprofile%</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          from anywhere and it will take you back to your user directory. From
          the User directory you should just need to type
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd Desktop</code></pre>
        then
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd parcel</code></pre>
        <p>to get to the right place. Then type</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm init -y</code></pre>
        <p>
          This will create a file called <kbd>package.json</kbd>. This file will
          contain the details about our project.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Modern web projects rely on a few types of tools to make them easier
            to manage.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Package Managers</dt>
            <dd>
              This tool controls all of the dependencies for the project...it
              lets us easliy include tools written by others to both help us in
              development, and to include additional functionality in our
              finished product. It really helps when it's time to update to a
              newer version of one of these tools.
            </dd>
            <dt>Asset Bundlers</dt>
            <dd>
              These gather all of the assets that our project needs and
              consolidates and processes them. A web app for example might have
              dozens of javascript files containing it's code. The bundler will
              combine them all together and minimize them...and then move the
              final file into a folder ready for distribution.
            </dd>
            <dt>Task Manager</dt>
            <dd>
              There are many processes that need to be run each time a change is
              made to the project. Sass needs to compiled and possibly
              autoprefixed and minimized, javascript combined and maybe
              transpiled, etc. A task manager can be configured to allow all of
              these tasks to be automated.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <br />
          <p>
            For this project <code>NPM</code> is our package manager. In fact
            when you ran <code>npm init</code> we did the first step in making
            this happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are using a tool called Parcel for bundling. Other popular
            bundlers would be <code>webpack</code> or <code>browserify</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally since our project is fairly simple we are actually using NPM
            as our task manager as well. If you look again in the
            <code>package.json</code> file you will see a section called
            <code>scripts</code>. We will place commands there to do different
            things for our project. Other popular task managers are Grunt and
            Gulp
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          Install Parcel by typing
          <code>npm install --save-dev parcel</code> (make sure that you are in
          the same directory that the <kbd>package.json</kbd> file is in) in the
          terminal. This will add Parcel as a development dependancy to our
          project...a tool that we will use as developers to do our work. You
          should notice that a couple of things changed: first a new folder
          called <kbd>node_modules</kbd> was created, second a new section
          called <code>devDependencies</code> was added to our
          <kbd>package.json.</kbd>
        </p>
        <p>
          Next we need to add some scripts to allow us to use Parcel. Add the
          following code to the <kbd>scripts</kbd> section of your
          <kbd>package.json</kbd>
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-js">
"scripts": {
    "start": "parcel ./src/index.html",
    "prebuild": "npx rimraf build",
    "build": "parcel build --public-url ./ ./src/index.html  --out-dir build"
},
        </code></pre>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          The Bootstrap instructions recommend the following file structure:
        </p>
        <pre>
project-name/
├── build/
├── node_modules/
│   └── bootstrap/
│   └── popper.js/
├── scss/
│   └── custom.scss
├── src/
│   └── index.html
│   └── index.js
└── package.json</pre
        >
        <p>
          The <kbd>build</kbd> directory will get created automatically for us
          later, but we should create the other folders and files now.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a <kbd>scss</kbd> directory in the root of the project
            folder, then add a <kbd>custom.scss</kbd> file inside of that
            directory.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a <kbd>src</kbd> directory in the root of the project folder
            and then create files called <kbd>index.html</kbd> and
            <kbd>index.js</kbd> in that folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open up the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file and add the following code:
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="../scss/custom.scss" &gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello Bootstrap&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p class="alert alert-primary"&gt;Demo site illustrating using a build tool to install Bootstrap&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;script src="./index.js" type="module"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
            </code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Notice the file we linked to for our styles. We linked directly to
            the <code>.scss</code> file. That should not work! Browsers do not
            understand <code>.scss</code>! Our bundler Parcel needs the path to
            the SCSS so it can find it, and it will automatically convert the
            SCSS to CSS and update the <code>link</code> in the
            <kbd>index.html</kbd> for us when it is done.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Test our installation by running the following</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm run start</code></pre>
        <p>
          in the command line of your computer. Make sure you are still in the
          project folder. (the same folder that contains the
          <kbd>package.json</kbd> file) This will start up a simple web server
          pointed at our project. It will also watch for changes to either the
          .SCSS files or the .JS files and it will recompile them when needed
          and refresh the page in the browser. It
          <strong>is not</strong> watching the .HTML file however. So if you
          make changes to that you will need to refresh the browser manually.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see your site notice that Parcel output
          <kbd>Server running at <code>http://localhost:1234</code></kbd> when
          it started up. Your port number (ie :1234) will probably be different.
          Enter that url in your browser to see it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are ready to stop the web server type <code>ctrl+c</code> in
          the command line.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
          Next let's install Bootstrap using our package manager. Go back to
          your command prompt and quit the webserver if it is running (ctrl+c).
          Then type
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm install bootstrap</code></pre>

        <!-- <div class="callout">
          <p>
            You may be asking yourselves: "I thought we just needed Bootstrap?
            Why Jquery and popper.js?" In order to use many of the Bootstrap
            components Bootstrap requires those two javascript libraries in
            order to function. Luckily they are easy to add with a package
            manager.
          </p>
        </div> -->
        <p>
          The add command retrieved the packages and placed them into the
          <code>node_modules</code> directory, but our project still doesn't
          know about them. Lets do that next.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>
          Finish adding Bootstrap into your project by opening the
          <code>src/index.js</code> file in an editor and adding the following
          line at the very top:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
// Import all plugins
import * as bootstrap from 'bootstrap';
            </code> </pre>
        <p>
          Those lines will make it possible for our project to use the
          libraries. Notice that we didn't give much information about
          <em>where</em> the actual files were located...our bundler is smart
          enough to find them as long as they are mentioned in
          <code>package.json</code> and installed in <code>node_modules</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then open up the <code>/scss/custom.scss</code> file and add the
          following line just under the <code>@import</code> for the variables
          partial:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-scss">
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
            </code> </pre>
        <p class="callout">
          We imported ALL of Bootstrap with that line. That is not always the
          best thing to do, we should really only import the parts of Bootstrap
          we are using. Check out the
          <a
            href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/customize/sass/#importing"
            target="_blank"
            >Bootstrap docs on importing</a
          >
          to see how you can be more selective about what you include.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok, lets try firing up our development server again. Type
          <code>npm run start</code>. Your page should have picked up a bit more
          styling...different font, and the alert should be styled. If you see
          that then it's working! If not then review the directions above, or
          ask for help.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Take a minute to notice that a new folder was created by Parcel
            called <kbd>dist</kbd> and check out the files that were generated:
            <code>dist/index.?????.css</code> and
            <code>dist/index.??????.js</code>. Notice that they are each over
            200KB now! Over 400KB of stuff just to make Bootstrap work...that is
            a lot. The FamilySearch homepage has a total budget of ~60KB for all
            of it's html, css, and Javascript for example!
          </p>
          <p>
            We did include all of Bootstrap however. A better option would be to
            only include the parts we intend to use.
