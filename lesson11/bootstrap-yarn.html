            <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>
            advertises itself as the "world's most popular front-end component
            library". I can't speak to the veracity of that statement, but I do
            know it <em>is</em> pretty cool.
          </p>
          <p>
            A framework is really just a collection of code (in this case html,
            css, and javascript) and design patterns that solve common design
            problems. Bootstrap is no exception. It started out as a styleguide
            for Twitter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most projects have the same core set of issues that have to be
            addressed. One huge advantage of css frameworks (or any framework
            for that matter) is that they have solutions pre-built and more
            importantly very well tested to those core problems. Thus they can
            save developers a lot of time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
        <p>
          There are several utilities you will need to make sure are working on
          your computer for the install to go smoothly. If you followed the
          <a href="../lesson01/l01-software.html" target="_blank"
            >software setup instructions</a
          >
          you should be most of the way there. Here is a list of things to
          verify. Open a command line window and try the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure that NPM (Node Package Manager) is working by entering:
            <pre><code class="bash">npm -v</code></pre>
            You should see a version number. If you get any errors or "command
            not found" try running through the
            <a href="../lesson01/l01-software.html" target="_blank"
              >software setup instructions</a
            >
            again.
          </li>
          <li>
            Install Yarn (a javascript package manager) by entering
            <pre><code class="bash">npm install -g yarn</code></pre>
            .
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you run into any issues get some help from a fellow student or the
          instructor.
        </p>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>
          Bootstrap gives several options for use. The simplest would be to
          simply download the full, compiled CSS file, and link it into your
          html normally. This is a great option to get up and going quickly, but
          is not really great for production. Most sites will not use all of
          what Bootstrap offers and so downloading the full CSS is overkill.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next option would be to take advantage a CDN (content delivery
          network). This is a server optimized for speed that has one
          job...serve up libraries. Bootstrap's CDN can be included by adding
          the following lines to your html
        </p>
        <pre><code class="html">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Gn5384xqQ1aoWXA+058RXPxPg6fy4IWvTNh0E263XmFcJlSAwiGgFAW/dAiS6JXm" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-JZR6Spejh4U02d8jOt6vLEHfe/JQGiRRSQQxSfFWpi1MquVdAyjUar5+76PVCmYl" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    </code></pre>
        <p>You would also need to include JQuery for this to work.</p>
        <p>
          Bootstrap can also be quickly integrated into a codepen. If you click
          on the CSS setting (gear icon next to CSS) then scroll down to the
          "Add External CSS section" you will see a drop down labeled
          "Quick-add". Bootstrap is one of the options there. This can let you
          quickly try something out.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best option however is to take advantage of Bootstrap's Sass
          version. The rest of this activity will have us install Bootstrap into
          a project with a professional style workflow.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Download the
          <a href="../resources/webpack.zip">Boilerplate code</a> and extract it
          to your Desktop on your hard drive
        </p>
        <p>
          Open your command line prompt on your computer and navigate to the
          directory containing the downloaded code. Mac and Windows should start
          you in your user directory when you open a new command prompt. Or you
          can type:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mac:
            <pre><code class="bash">cd ~</code></pre>
            (tilde) or
          </li>
          <li>
            Windows:
            <pre><code class="bash">cd %userprofile%</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          from anywhere and it will take you back to your user directory. From
          the User directory you should just need to type
        </p>
        <pre><code class="bash">cd Desktop</code></pre>
        then
        <pre><code class="bash">cd webpack</code></pre>
        <p>to get to the right place. Then type</p>
        <pre><code class="bash">yarn install</code></pre>
        <p>It might take a few minutes</p>
        <div class="callout">
          <h2>Attention!</h2>
          <p>
            If you get an error complaining about your Node being incompatible
            with a package then you will need to use this alternate syntax:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="bash">yarn install --ignore-engines</code></pre>
        </div>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Once you have it installed go take a look at the file structure. The
            boilerplate that you received is setup similar to what you might
            find with any small to medium scale modern web project. Modern
            development projects end up with a lot of moving parts. There are
            dependencies...other utilities or libraries that are being used to
            speed up things. Some of those have special requirements as well.
            Sass would be one example...it needs to be compiled before it can be
            used.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modern web projects rely on a few types of tools to make them easier
            to manage.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Package Managers</dt>
            <dd>
              This tool controls all of the dependencies for the project...it
              lets us easliy include tools written by others to both help us in
              development, and to include additional functionality in our
              finished product. It really helps when it's time to update to a
              newer version of one of these tools.
            </dd>
            <dt>Asset Bundlers</dt>
            <dd>
              These gather all of the assets that our project needs and
              consolidates and processes them. A web app for example might have
              dozens of javascript files containing it's code. The bundler will
              combine them all together and minimize them...and then move the
              final file into a folder ready for distribution.
            </dd>
            <dt>Task Manager</dt>
            <dd>
              There are many processes that need to be run each time a change is
              made to the project. Sass needs to compiled and possibly
              autoprefixed and minimized, javascript combined and maybe
              transpiled, etc. A task manager can be configured to allow all of
              these tasks to be automated.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <br />
          <p>
            For this project <code>Yarn</code> is our package manager. In fact
            when you ran <code>yarn install</code> it went and looked at the
            <code>package.json</code> file to see what dependencies the project
            has, then retrieved them and put them into a directory called
            <code>node_modules</code>. Another popular package manager is
            <code>npm</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            We are using a tool called Webpack for bundling. There is a
            configuration file for it as well: <code>webpack.config.js</code>.
            Another popular bundler would be <code>browserify</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally since our project is fairly simple we are actually using
            Yarn as our task manager as well. If you look again in the
            <code>package.json</code> file you will see a section called
            <code>scripts</code>. these are commands we can run to do different
            things for our project. Other popular task managers are Grunt and
            Gulp
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>To test your installation type the following:</p>
        <pre><code class="bash">yarn start</code></pre>
        <p>
          in the command line of your computer. Make sure you are still in the
          project folder. This will start up a simple web server pointed at our
          project. It will also watch for changes to either the .SCSS files or
          the .JS files and it will recompile them when needed and refresh the
          page in the browser. It <strong>is not</strong> watching the .HTML
          file however. So if you make changes to that you will need to refresh
          the browser manually.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are ready to stop the web server type <code>ctrl+c</code> in
          the command line.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should see a simple unstyled button and a message:
          <code>Setup Appears to be working 😉</code>
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          Next let's install Bootstrap using our package manager. Go back to
          your command prompt and quit the webserver if it is running (ctrl+c).
          Then type
        </p>
        <pre><code class="bash">yarn add bootstrap jquery popper.js</code></pre>
        <div class="callout">
          <h2>Attention!</h2>
          <p>
            If you got the Node error earlier you will need to run the following
            command instead:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="bash">yarn add --ignore-engines bootstrap jquery popper.js </code></pre>
        </div>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            You may be asking yourselves: "I thought we just needed Bootstrap?
            Why Jquery and popper.js?" In order to use many of the Bootstrap
            components Bootstrap requires those two javascript libraries in
            order to function. Luckily they are easy to add with a package
            manager.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The add command retrieved the packages and placed them into the
          <code>node_modules</code> directory, but our project still doesn't
          know about them. Lets do that next.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
          Finish adding Bootstrap into your project by opening the
          <code>assets/js/index.js</code> file in an editor and adding the
          following lines at the very top:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="javascript">
import $ from "jquery";
import popper from 'popper.js';
import bootstrap from 'bootstrap';
            </code> </pre>
        <p>
          Those lines will make it possible for our project to use those
          libraries. Notice that we didn't give much information about
          <em>where</em> the actual files were located...our bundler is smart
          enough to find them as long as they are mentioned in
          <code>package.json</code> and installed in <code>node_modules</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then open up the <code>assets/scss/styles.scss</code> file and add the
          following line just under the <code>@import</code> for the variables
          partial:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="javascript">
@import "node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
            </code> </pre>
        <p>
          Ok, lets try firing up our development server again. Type
          <code>yarn start</code>. Your page should have picked up a bit more
          styling...different font, button styled, and you should see one more
          message indicating that Jquery is working. If you see that then it's
          working! If not then review the directions above, or ask for help.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Take a minute and check out the files that were generated:
            <code>assets/css/styles.css</code> and
            <code>assets/js/bundle.js</code>. Notice that they are each around
            150KB now! Over 300KB of stuff just to make Bootstrap work...that is
            a lot. The FamilySearch homepage has a total budget of ~60KB for all
            of it's html, css, and Javascript for example!
          </p>
          <p>
            We did include all of Bootstrap however. A better option would be to
            only include the parts we intend to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you look inside of the
            <code>node_modules/bootstrap/scss</code> directory you will see a
            long list of partials. These could be included individually instead
            of all at once if we wanted.
