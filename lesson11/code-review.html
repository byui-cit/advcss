			<h1>CSS Code Review</h1>
                        
			<hr />
			<div class="callout">
			<p>We've been reading and talking a lot this week about css organization and architecture.  We've only scratched the surface.  This is an issue that every developer faces, and there are about as many opinions on the correct way to do it as there are developers...or projects...maybe even developers X projects.  That's how many opinions there are ;)</p>
			<div>You will eventually develop your own opinions as well. This activity will hopefully help you begin to do that by reviewing the css for a popular project...Bootstrap.</div>
    
    
    </div>
			<h2>Activity</h2>
			<p>Based on the reading and discussions of this week about organization and architecture we will review the source code (css) for the Bootstrap framework and discuss what they have done to organize their code. </p>
<h3>Step 1</h3>			 
    <p>Make sure to complete the <a href="bootstrap.html" target="_blank">Bootstrap installation</a> activity before continuing. You can find the Bootstrap src files in <code>node_modules/bootstrap/scss</code></p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
						<p> Review Bootstrap and write-up your thoughts considering the following as you review:  </p>
			<ul>
			    <li>Is the styling is de-coupled from the html structure? Try using a few components in a page like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/" target="_blank">button</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/" target="_blank">navbar</a>, or <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/progress/" target="_blank">progress bar</a>. (If you visit Css settings in codepen you can quickly add Bootstrap as an External CSS resourceâ€¦see the Quick-add box)  Can you use them by just using classes or do they require very specific markup to work?</li>
			    <li>Which if any of the philosophies we discussed this week they might be using (BEM, Atomic, OOCSS, etc)?</li>
			   <li>Are the folders they use well named?</li>
             <li>Check out the variables partial.  Imagine trying to customize Bootstrap without that settings file! Consider the advantages Sass gives to both the organization and customization of Bootstrap.</li>
             <li>If you were a developer working on this code and you were asked to work on on something specific...like headline styles...how hard would it be to locate the code and modify it? Would you worry about your changes having unintended consequences after reviewing the class names and architecture of that portion of css?</li>
			     <li>Do you like how it is organized?  Would you change anything?</li>
			   
			</ul>   
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 03:</span>&nbsp; Submit your notes to Ilearn.</p>
						
			<h2>Grading</h2>
