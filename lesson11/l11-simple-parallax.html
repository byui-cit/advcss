			<h1>A Simple Parallax effect</h1>

			<div class="callout">
                <p>Parallax is when you have foregrounds and backgrounds moving at different speeds relative to each other.  It creates a feeling of depth in a web page and is a very popular technique currently. Most parallax implementations are done with a combination of Javascript and css, though a <a href="http://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/" target="_blank">pure css parallax</a> is possible as well.</p>
			<div>It is possible to achieve a parallax like effect quite simply however.  This is what we will look at with this activity.</div>
    
    
    </div>
			<h2>Activity</h2>
    <p>Review the example at <a href="https://codyhouse.co/demo/alternate-fixed-scroll-background/index.html" target="_blank">codyhouse</a> to see what the goal is, then review the <a href="https://codyhouse.co/gem/alternate-fixed-scroll-backgrounds/" target="_blank">accompanying article</a>.</p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Find a piece of paper, an index card would work especially well.  Holding it think about all of the different things you can do with it.  Make a list. Spend several minutes on this.  Review your list and think about how those actions might translate into a web interface and what you might use them for.  </p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; Choose two actions from your list that you thought of good use cases for (and that you think you can actually implement) and using transitions, animations, and transforms implement them as a codepen. </p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Step 03:</span>&nbsp; Submit the url to your codepen to Ilearn. Add your list of actions as well as a comment. </p>
