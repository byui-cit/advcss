			<h1>Building your first website with bootstrap</h1>

                <p>This week I would like you to complete <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/building-your-first-website-with-bootstrap-4-2995" target="_blank">Building your first website with Bootstrap</a> course from Sitepoint.  The course is quite well done, but we need to make a few adjustments to because of the way we have setup our Bootstrap app and because the course was made using the beta version of the framework and a few things changed.</p>
                
                <p>Watch for these things:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li>In the first lesson below the video there is a link to download the assets for the course. You will want to do this to get the images you will need.  Copy them in to a folder called <code>images</code> in your <code>assets</code> directory.</li>
                    <li>In the second lesson don't follow the installation instructions. You should use the Bootstrap installation we did last week for this project.</li>
                    <li>Also in lesson 2 the <code>navbar-inverse</code> class got renamed to <code>navbar-dark</code></li>
                    <li></li>
                    <li><p>In the last lesson the course introduces FontAwesome. You could install it as the course recommends...or you could use your package manager :)  To install it with yarn do the following: In the command line (and while in the project folder) type:</p>
                    <pre><code class="bash">yarn add font-awesome</code> </pre>
                    <p>then in your <code>assets/scss/styles.scss</code> file add the following lines towards the top:</p>
                    <pre><code class="scss">
$fa-font-path:"../../node_modules/font-awesome/fonts";
@import "node_modules/font-awesome/scss/font-awesome";</code> </pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
    
    
    </div>
		<p>Once you have completed your site do a production build:</p>	
   <pre><code class="bash">yarn build</code> </pre>
   <p>Then compress (archive) up your assets folder and submit it in Ilearn.</p>
   <h2>Grading</h2>
