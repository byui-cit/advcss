			<h1>Next Steps with Foundation</h1>
                        
			<hr />
			<div >
                <p>This week I would like you to complete <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/next-steps-in-foundation-2883" target="_blank">Next Steps in Foundation</a> course from Sitepoint.  The course is quite well done (I especially like the prototyping sections), but it was made for Foundation v5 and a few things changed.</p>
                
                <p>Watch for these things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Foundation 5 used a directory called <code>stylesheets</code> for it's final css.  In Foundation 6 this is simply <code>css</code></li>
                    <li>I would probably just skip lesson 2.  It walks through the basics of Sass, then installing the Sass version of Foundation. The installation instructions have changed. If you completed the <a href="../lesson11/l11-foundation.html" target="_blank">Foundation</a> activity from last week you should already have it running.</li>
                    <li>You may find a few mentions of Compass.  that was part of the old installation...if you see <code>compass watch</code> translate it to <code>npm start</code></li>
                    <li>The last major thing is in the lesson on Optimization.  That has changed as well. Before if you wanted everything you uncommented the <code>@import 'foundation'</code> line and left everything else commented. To get just specific parts you commented out <code>@import 'foundation'</code> and then uncommented the parts you need.  Now you must leave the <code>@import 'foundation'</code> uncommented always and just adjust the <code>@includes</code> below. </li>
                </ul>
