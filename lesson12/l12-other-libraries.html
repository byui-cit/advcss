                <p>Foundation is just one of many CSS frameworks/libraries. Lists like this <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/free-css3-frameworks/" target="_blank">top 21 css frameworks</a> are pretty common to try to help developers keeps tabs on all of them. Lets review a just a few that you should be aware of.</p>
                
                <p>Watch for these things:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://modernizr.com" target="_blank">Modernizr</a>: Runs a series of tests as the page loads to determine what features of html and css are supported in the current browser.  Using the results of that can allow developers to deliver tiered experiences.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" target="_blank">Normalize</a>: Browsers come with different default styles for common html elements.  Normalize helps bring these together for a more consistent experience.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://compass-style.org" target="_blank">Compass</a> and <a href="http://bourbon.io" target="_blank">Bourbon</a>: Both of these have collections of commonly used Sass mixins and partials. Compass is probably a bit more full featured, Bourbon is lighter weight</li>
                    <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>: Another full framework similar to Foundation.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://material.google.com" target="_blank">Material Design</a>: the link I provided is not to a framework or library.  Material Design is actually a set of specifications about how a Google app should be styled.  It has become quite popular, to the point that there are many css frameworks that have been built to aid in implementing it. </li>
                    <li><a href="http://getuikit.com" target="_blank">UIkit</a>: This is a collection of css and js to implement ui elements and interfaces quickly.</li>
                    
                </ul>

    <h2>Activity</h2>
    <p>I've talked about a few libraries above.  All of mine are pretty general purpose.  There are also many specific use frameworks as well out there. These frameworks are built to accomplish on specific thing. This could be anything from a simple grid, to parallax scrolling to fancy slideshows. Your task will be to choose one and learn a bit about it to share with the class.</p>
	<p><span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Do some searches online for css libraries.  Choose one specific task library and learn a bit about it...then share what you learned with the class on the Class discussion board.</p>
