			<h1>CSS Zen Garden Final</h1>
    <div class="callout">
    <p>It's finally time to finsh the Zen Garden final.  Hopefully you have kept your goals in mind over the semester and been thinking about how to implement your plans. Here is a reminder about what you were told earlier:</p>


<ol>
   <li>Your Zen Garden version should follow a theme.</li>
    <li>You need to follow the Zen Garden guidelines. They are all outlined in the content on the page (You read that right?)  You must have rights to any media you use.  I would actually recommend that you try and produce all your graphics with either CSS or SVG. (This means don’t spend a lot of time creating art.  Keep it simple). Remember also that you are not allowed to modify the html…so any imagery you add has to be in the css.</li>
    <li>The Zen Garden guidelines do not require responsiveness,  I do. Your final product must be responsive.</li>
    <li>All the CSS must be your own work.  Libraries are great at times…but this is not one of them.</li>
</ol>
    </div>
   
    <p> Once done one person in the group should submit the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The names of all members of the group,</li>
        <li>a description of the theme you have chosen and ideas about how you will incorporate it into your design,</li>
        <li>either a URL where your project can be seen <strong>or</strong> and archive of your files.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Final project follows the Zen Garden guidelines (read the content of your page if you have forgotten what these are).  15pts</li>
     <li>Final project makes good use of the proposed theme 10pts</li>
     <li>Final project is responsive. 5pts</li>
      <li>SCSS is used and the file is provided. 5pts</li>
       <li>Compiled css is valid. 5pts</li>
       
    </ul>
