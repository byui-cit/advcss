          This course cannot possibly cover all of the topics in CSS in a
          semester. The first outcome of the course talks about becoming better
          at learning how to learn. In that spirit this module allows you to
          choose a topic not provided in the existing modules and learn about
          it.

          Your inspiration can come from several different sources. It could be
          something you read on a twitter feed, an article about an up and
          coming CSS feature found on a blog or website, or it could be
          something cool that you see while browsing online and want to learn
          how to replicate.
        </p>
        <h2>Prepare</h2>
        <p>
          Begin by finding 2-3 good resources about your topic. These can be
          blog posts, articles, tutorials, or videos. Study your resources until
          you feel you have gained an understanding of the topic. Spend 1-3
          hours with this study.
        </p>

        <h2>Ponder/Prove/Objective:</h2>
        <p>
          Find or design a small project to help you practice and apply the
          knowledge/skills you gained above. Create a codepen demonstrating what
          you have accomplished. Your project should take 3-4 hours.

            Another approach that could be taken with this activity can be found
            here: <a href="repeat-find-examples.html">Find Examples</a>. You
            would only need to find one example in this case, and you could
            negotiate with the instructor based on your example whether one week
            or two would be more appropriate to accomplish your goals.
