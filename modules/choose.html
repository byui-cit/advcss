        <p>
          This course cannot possibly cover all of the topics in CSS in a
          semester. The first outcome of the course talks about becoming better
          at learning how to learn. In that spirit this module allows you to
          choose a topic not provided in the existing modules and learn about
          it. You may complete this module up to three times, once for Tools,
          once for layout, and once for CSS.

        <h2>Prepare</h2>
        <p>
          Begin by finding 2-3 good resources about your topic. These can be
          blog posts, articles, tutorials, or videos. Study your resources until
          you feel you have gained an understanding of the topic. Spend 1-2
          hours with this study.
        </p>

        <h2>Ponder/Prove</h2>
        <p>
          Find or design a small project to help you practice and apply the
          knowledge/skills you gained above. Create a codepen demonstrating what
          you have accomplished. Your project should take 1-2 hours.
