        <h2>Prepare</h2>
        <p>
          It is recommended that you complete the
          <a href="css-shapes-gradients.html" target="_blank">CSS Shapes</a>
          module before attempting this.
        </p>

        <h2>Ponder/Prove</h2>
        <p>
          Visit the
          <a href="https://cssbattle.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >CSSBattle</a
          >
          site. Choose one or more challenges to complete. Complete as many as
          you can in 6 hours. For most students this will be 1-3. CSSBattle
          stresses the length of your solution, I do not want you to worry about
          length for this assignment, just get it done. You also do not have to
          submit it to CSSBattle if you do not want to. When you are finished
          take a screenshot of your work.
        </p>
        <p>Be prepared to do some research in order to solve the challenges!</p>
