          Custom Properties are a long awaited addition to CSS. They allow for
          the setting of variables right in the CSS. One of the most exciting
          features is that these variables can be changed at any time with by
          either CSS override or Javascript.

        <p>Complete the following activity:</p>
        <p>
          Imagine you have been asked by a client to produce a prototype of a
          web component that includes a headline, paragraph, and image. The
          headline and paragraph typeface should look noticably different but
          size and download speed is a major concern for this project. You can
          only use one font.
        </p>

            rel="noreferrer"
            >Google Fonts</a
          >
          has added support for Variable Fonts and has several free ones to
          choose from. Select one and then use it to produce your prototype. For
          the most flexibility you should download the font and define your own
          <code>@font-face</code> instead of using the Google Fonts generated
          CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take advantage of the resources in the articles to help you discover
          how many different looks your font might have.
