              <li>Successfully apply your new knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Prepare</h2>
        <p>
          As you review the following resources on creating CSS shapes and
          Gradients keep in mind our objectives. Notice that one of those is not
          "spend x minutes reading" or "read x number of articles". Instead our
          goal is to gain some specific knowledge and skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of becoming better at learning is recognizing how much time you
          need to spend gathering new knowledge before you should start trying
          to apply your new knowledge. Too much time gathering and not enough
          application is bad, but so is jumping straight into application
          without enough time first spent building a foundation of knowledge to
          pull from!
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that some of the resources here are more references (things that
          will be helpful to pull up as you are applying your knowledge), and
          others are more instructional (teach you how to use the technologies).
          You should spend most of your prepare time on the instructional
          resources. Essentially, study these resources until you feel
          comfortable with the concepts, then go try it!
