          Variable Fonts are an exciting new addition to CSS. They help us solve
          the problem of excessive weight added to a page when several styles of
          custom fonts are required (bold, italic, etc).

        <h2>Ponder/Prove</h2>
        <p>Complete the following activity:</p>
        <p>
          Imagine you have been asked by a client to produce a prototype of a
          web component that includes a headline, paragraph, and image. The
          headline and paragraph font should look noticably different but size
          and download speed is a major concern for this project. You can only
          use one font.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://fonts.google.com/?vfonly"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >Google Fonts</a
          >
          has added support for Variable Fonts and has several free ones to
          choose from. Select one and then use it to produce your prototype. For
          the most flexibility you should download the font and define your own
          <code>@font-face</code> instead of using the Google Fonts generated
          CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take advantage of the resources in the articles to help you discover
          how many different looks your font might have.
