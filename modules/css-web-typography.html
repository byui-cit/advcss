          At the end of the day the purpose of most websites is to share
          information. That information is overwhelmingly given in the form of
          Type. We often give no more thought to our type than to pick a font
          that we like. Learning the elements of typographical style can help
          you to improve your design's ability to give information in a clear
          and attractive way. This module will introduce simple principles that
          can be followed along with some of the CSS you will need to apply
          those principles to your site.
