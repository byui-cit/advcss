            Hard to believe I know, but animations and transitions can be used
            for more than creating card tricks :) If you start paying attention
            you will begin to see them all over the place. The best are quite
            subtle. One area I am seeing a lot of them currently is in menus. It
            can make the appearance and disappearance of a menu much more
            pleasing to not have them pop in and out suddenly. Another current
            trend is
            <a
              href="https://codyhouse.co/demo/full-page-intro-and-navigation/index.html"
              target="_blank"
              >full screen overlay menus</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Effects such as that require a few different techniques. You need to
            know how to make something take up 100% of the width and height of
            the viewport, you need to understand layering, triggering an event
            on a click, moving stuff around, and transitions to smooth it all
            out.

        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>
          As we have discussed before one of the skills that will be the most
          valuable for you to deve lop during this course (and others) is the
          ability to read and understand code examples from others. For this
          activity you complete a tutorial that will teach us several of the
          effects above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tutorial we will be completing for this activity is:
          <a
            href="https://css-tricks.com/creating-css-sliding-door-effect/"
            target="_blank"
            >Creating a sliding door effect</a
          >
          on CSS Tricks. Create a new codepen and complete the tutorial. Include
          comments throughout the html and css to show that you understand what
          each section is doing.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            The amount of benefit you receive from this activity will vary
            greatly based on how much effort you put into it to
            <em>understanding</em> what is going on instead of just focusing on
            getting it done.
          </p>
          <p>
            One way to tell if you have really grasped the concepts would be to
            try and modify it to work differently. Try for example to change it
            to work opposite of what it does now...have the background shown
            initially, and when something is clicked have it show...or maybe
            have only one side show. If you can do that you are halfway to
            making a menu that slides out from the side...
