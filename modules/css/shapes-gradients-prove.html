            It's said that one of the best ways to learn something is to have to
            teach it. This week you had the opportunity to learn about creating
            shapes with CSS. To help the concepts you were introduced to this
            week stick, I would like to give you the opportunity to teach
            someone else about them. You need to create a walkthrough
            instructing how to create a specific shape with css and borders, or
            how to create a repeating background with a gradient.

        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 1</span>: &nbsp; Complete the ponder
          activities for this module, then decide whether you would like to base
          your walkthrough on a shape (border-radius) or a background
          (gradients). If you decide on a shape with border radius, you might
          refer back to the
          <a href="https://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/" target="_blank"
            >CSS-Tricks: Shapes of CSS</a
          >
          article for ideas. Or you could make a new shape of your own design.
        </p>

          If you decide on a repeating background with gradients...then

        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 2</span>: &nbsp; Study your example until
          you understand what each line is doing, then prepare your code and
          script for your walkthrough and create a screencast of you teaching
          the material you have prepared. Try to keep your screencast to around
          3 minutes. Post your screencast to the class discussion. If you don't
          have some screencast creation software that you already use I've had
          pretty good success with
