            One of the most important skills you can develop in your life is
            that of creative problem solver. You often will run into (or be
            given) difficult tasks that you are pretty sure you don't have the
            tools to accomplish. (<a
              href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng"

            >).
          </p>
          <p>
            Web design and development has many good examples of this. During
            almost every project it seems the client comes up with some critical
            feature that you are pretty sure is impossible.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the internet is full of examples of many very creative
            solutions to problems that were thought impossible to solve given
            the current toolset...until someone saw how to use those tools in
            ways never before imagined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take the tool of the humble border-radius. It was added to give
            designers the ability to have
            <a

          </p>
          <p>
            (I'm serious about that...click on each of those links...read,
            watch, then come back.)
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Activity Directions</h2>
        <p>
          Now that you have a bit of background (you watched and read
          above...right?) Let's practice. I would first like to walkthrough
          making a heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 1</span>: &nbsp; Open
          <a href="http://codepen.io" target="_blank">codepen.io</a> and login
          to your account if you are not already. Click on the +New Pen button
          at the top right of the screen. We will not be using any Javascript
          for this, so lets close that pane to free up some space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 2</span>: &nbsp; Lets add a bit of html
          to get us started. Type the following into the html pane:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="html">
        &lt;div class="heart"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 3</span>: &nbsp; Lets give our
          <kbd>div</kbd> some dimensions and color. Add the following to the css
          pane:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-css">
.heart {
    width: 50px;
    height: 80px;
    background: red;
}
            </code></pre>
        <p>You should now see a red rectangle in the view pane.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 4</span>: &nbsp; Lets try playing with
          the border radius. Add the <kbd>border-radius:</kbd> property to your
          css and try several different values.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you start with a low value (5px for example) and work your way up
          to 50px you should see the border becoming more and more
          rounded...after 50px however it will stop changing. Because the width
          is of the rectangle is 50px, it is as rounded as it can be.
        </p>

        <p class="callout">
          This is actually how you make a circle. Start with a square, then set
          the border-radius to be the same or greater than the width of the
          square. You could also just set it to 100%. Try changing the border
          radius of our rectangle to 100% though...what happened?
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 5</span>: &nbsp; Hearts are not rounded
          on all sides, so lets modify our shape to only be rounded on the top.
          (Remember that you can specify the radius of each corner
          independently...top-left top-right bottom-right bottom-left) Your code
          should look something like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-css">
.heart {
    width: 50px;
    height: 80px;
    background: red;
    border-radius: 50px 50px 0 0;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 6</span>: &nbsp; Great, we are actually
          halfway done. Now you are probably thinking to yourself...'This
          doesn't look much like a heart!'. Lets add one more line of css. Add
          the following:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-css">transform: rotate(45deg);</code></pre>
        <p>
          Now if you squint a bit hopefully you can see that we have half a
          heart.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            We need a second heart half now. We could simply add another div to
            the html, but it would be rather nice to keep that simple. I like
            the thought of just adding
            <code>&lt;div class="heart"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> to get a heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            To keep our html markup simple we are going ot take advantage of the
            <kbd>::before</kbd> and <kdb>::after</kdb> pseudo elements. Remember
            they let us insert content that can be styled before or after any
            other content.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 7</span>: &nbsp; We need to make a few
          changes to our css to convert it to using pseudo-elements. change your
          .heart rule to resemble the following:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-css">
.heart:before,
.heart:after {
    content: "";
    width: 50px;
    height: 80px;
    background: red;
    border-radius: 50px 50px 0 0;
    transform: rotate(-45deg);
    transform-origin :0 100%;
}</code></pre>
        <p class="callout">
          When you made that change you might have been surprised to find your
          shape disappeared! Turns out that content inserted with ::before or
          ::after is treated as inline. Inline elements remember ignore height
          and width. Add <kbd>display:block;</kbd> to your css and you shapes
          will come back.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 8</span>: &nbsp; After adding the
          <kbd>display:block;</kbd> you should now see 2 shapes. They are both
          exactly the same right now...we will need to rotate one of them the
          opposite direction. We can do that with the folllowing css:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-css">
.heart:after {
    transform: rotate(45deg);
    transform-origin :100% 100%;
}</code></pre>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            You might have noticed the <kbd>transform-origin</kbd> I slipped in
            on the last couple of steps. We will talk more about transforms
            later...but for now, that property changes what point the element
            rotates around. Default is
            <kbd>transform-origin :50% 50%;</kbd> which would be the center of
            the object.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the lines we added would make the ::before element rotate around
            the bottom right corner, the ::after element would rotate around the
            bottom left. the reason we want them to rotate in that way will
            become apparent in the next step.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 9</span>: &nbsp; We are getting close,
          the last step is to get the 2 parts to overlap in just the right way.
          We will do this with <kbd>position: absolute</kbd> Add that line to
          the <kbd>.heart::before, .heart::after</kbd> rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should now see why we wanted to change the rotation point for each
          half. All we need to do to finish up now is to slide the halves a bit
          horizontally. If we add the appropriate left, and top lines your code
          should end up looking something like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-css">
.heart:before,
.heart:after {
    position: absolute;
    content: "";
    top: 0;
    left: 50px;
    width: 50px;
    height: 80px;
    background: red;
    border-radius: 50px 50px 0 0;
    transform: rotate(-45deg);
    transform-origin :0 100%;

}
.heart:after {
    left: 0;
    transform: rotate(45deg);
    transform-origin :100% 100%;
}</code></pre>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            At this point we really just have a bit of cleanup to do. I did some
            of it in the last step. Notice I removed the
            <kdb>display:block;</kdb> line we added earlier.
            <kbd>position:absolute;</kbd> automatically changed the element to
            block so it became redundant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other cleanup deals with the positioning we used. We positioned
            with absolute. This positions the element relative to the top, left
            corner of the first non-static ancestor. In our case this is the top
            left corner of the screen. This isn't very practical. It would be
            better if the heart was positioned wherever the .heart div was. Lets
            add a bit more css to make that happen.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 10</span>: &nbsp; Add the following rule
          to your css to allow the heart to be positioned relative to where the
          .heart div is placed:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="lang-css">
.heart {
  position: relative;
  width: 100px;
  height: 90px;
  }</code>
            </pre>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 11</span>: &nbsp; One last thing. the
          transform property we used has pretty wide support...but there are a
          few browsers out there that don't recognize the default syntax still
          and need a prefixed version. Once we add the appropriate prefixes our
          final css should look like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-css">
.heart {
    position: relative;
    width: 100px;
    height: 90px;
}
.heart:before,
.heart:after {
    position: absolute;
    content: "";
    left: 50px;
    top: 0;
    width: 50px;
    height: 80px;
    background: red;
    -moz-border-radius: 50px 50px 0 0;
    border-radius: 50px 50px 0 0;
    -webkit-transform: rotate(-45deg);
      -moz-transform: rotate(-45deg);
        -ms-transform: rotate(-45deg);
        -o-transform: rotate(-45deg);
            transform: rotate(-45deg);
    -webkit-transform-origin: 0 100%;
      -moz-transform-origin: 0 100%;
        -ms-transform-origin: 0 100%;
        -o-transform-origin: 0 100%;
            transform-origin: 0 100%;
}
.heart:after {
    left: 0;
    -webkit-transform: rotate(45deg);
      -moz-transform: rotate(45deg);
        -ms-transform: rotate(45deg);
        -o-transform: rotate(45deg);
            transform: rotate(45deg);
    -webkit-transform-origin: 100% 100%;
      -moz-transform-origin: 100% 100%;
        -ms-transform-origin: 100% 100%;
        -o-transform-origin: 100% 100%;
            transform-origin: 100% 100%;
