        <h1>Animated Sliding Menu</h1>

        <hr />
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            We've looked at some good examples and information about
            transitions, animations, and transforms...now lets put it all
            together with something you might actually see in a real website!
          </p>
          <p>
            The project will be to build an animated sliding menu. As we begin
            you should know that I know that there are a lot of examples of this
            out there. Avoid the temptation to use those too much. You might
            look at one or two to get started...but you will learn the
            application of these concepts much much better if you do your own
            work. Make a rule of <strong>no copy/paste</strong> for this
            activity. Write every line of css yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember the goal here...it's <strong>not</strong> to just complete
            the assignment. Rather it's to learn how to effectively use
            animations and transitions on a website. You won't do that if you
            just copy and paste someone else's work here.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>
          You may want to review the
          <a href="animation-ponder.html" target="_blank">sliding curtain</a>
          activity from the animation module as you begin...many of the concepts
          applied there apply here as well.

            <p>Notice a few things:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The menu when closed should be a simple menu icon made up of 3
                horizontal bars. It should change on hover to let the user know
                they should click on it.
              </li>
              <li>
                When open notice that the menu should take up 100% of the
                height. It should not just suddenly <strong>pop</strong> open.
                Use a transition.
              </li>

              <li>
                Notice also on the open menu that the 3 bar menu icon is gone.
                In it's place is an X. The menu icon should use
                transitions/animations/transforms to change from the 3 bars to
                the X.
              </li>
              <li>The links and X should have a hover effect as well.</li>
              <li>
                In my example the menu covers up the content underneath. That is
                fine, or you might choose to slide the content over as well so
                that it is always visible. Another nice effect would be to apply
                a semi transparent background color to the content to let the
                user know they really should be focusing on the menu right now.
                This is optional.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <!-- End Step -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Start step -->
            <h3>Create the Menu icon</h3>
            <p>
              In a codepen create the menu icon first. To get you started html
              markup like this usually works well:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">
      &lt;div class="menu-icon"&gt;
              &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
                  </code> </pre>
            <p>
              *Remember that with that span and the use of the proper
              pseudo-elements you have 3 elements to play with...how convenient!
              We need a 3 bar menu! Furthermore each of the bars could be
              transformed independent of the others.
            </p>
            <!-- End Step -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Start step -->
            <h3>Transform Menu icon</h3>
            <p>
              Once you have a menu icon built work on transforming it to an X.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <h3>Event handling</h3>
              <p>
                Last week we learned about a slick hack involving checkboxes to
                trigger changes with css. Unfortunately that won't work for us
                this week. There are too many things that need to happen to too
                many elements. We will have to watch instead for a click on our
                menu icon with Javascript.
              </p>
              <p>
                Don't let that worry you! It's actually pretty easy. We can use
                the
                <code>onclick</code> attribute to attach a Javascript function
                we want to run when the icon is clicked.
              </p>
              <p>
                The function really just needs to add or remove a class to an
                element. Here is an example of what that might look like:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
      function toggleNav() {
             var updateElement = document.getElementById("menu-icon");
          //toggle adds a class if it's not there or removes it if it is.
          updateElement.classList.toggle("open");
      }              
      </code></pre>
              <p>
                That function would grab an element with
                <code>id="menu-icon"</code> and then it would check to see if it
                had a class <code>open</code> on it. If it finds it, the class
                will be removed, if it doesn't find it the class will be added.
                All of your CSS to transform the 3 bar menu to an X should be in
                that <code>.open</code> class.
              </p>
              <p>
                You could change more than one element in this same
                function...for example converting the bars to an X is just
                <em>one</em> of the things we need to happen when the icon is
                clicked. We also need to have the menu sidebar slide out. You
                could do the same thing...add another line to grab the sidebar
                element, then toggle a class on it.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you used my suggested starting html for the menu icon
                above...then added what you needed to watch for a click it would
                look something like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-markup">
      &lt;div class="menu-icon" id="menu-icon" onclick="toggleNav()"&gt;
              &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
                  </code></pre>
            </div>
            <!-- End Step -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Start step -->
            <h3>Finish up</h3>
            <p>
              Once the icon is working correctly add in the sidebar elements and
              links...then style them. Once that is done add css and code into
              the toggle function to make the sidebar slide in and out with a
              transition or animation applied.
            </p>
            <!-- End Step -->
          </li>
        </ol>
