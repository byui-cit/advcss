            Playing cards have been around in one form or another for a long
            time. They traditionally have very intricate patterns on the backs
            some of which are truly works of art. If you haven't looked at the
            back of a deck of cards recently take a minute and do a quick
            search.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will have you create 2 custom playing card backs. Both
          should include multiple shapes and should be inline SVG (right in the
          html). One of the cards should be entirely your own work. For the
          other you are welcome to incorporate SVG shapes you have found on the
          web.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 01:</span>&nbsp; Create a new pen in
          codepen.io. Make sure to change the css settings to use SCSS so you
          can take advantage of the things we learned last week. I would
          recommend starting with a simple rectangle with slightly rounded
          corners to define your card. Hint: the height of a card is generally
          1.4X the width.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Step 02:</span>&nbsp; Create your cards, when
          completed submit the url to your pen in ILearn.

            If you have issues with scaling your svg objects take another look
            at the article:
            <a
              href="https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/svg-coordinate-systems/"
              target="_blank"
              >Understanding SVG Coordinate Systems</a
            >
            along with the
            <a
              href="https://sarasoueidan.com/demos/interactive-svg-coordinate-system/index.html"
              target="_blank"
              >playground</a
            >
            that goes along with the article.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may run into some strange scaling issues if you use symbols with
            patterns. When you create a viewBox you essentially redefine the
            coordinate system the svg uses. If the viewBox is smaller than the
            viewPort (the size of the SVG element) then scaling will occur. Here
            is a
            <a href="http://codepen.io/matkat/pen/qZzMJz" target="_blank"
              >codepen</a

            with some examples of some of the behaviors you might see because of
            this. Make sure to read the comments.

            This assignment will also ask you to group some of your svg objects.
            There are some examples of this in the
            <a href="l05-shapes-svg.html" target="_blank">SVG Shapes</a>
            activity you should have completed, but here is another article that
            goes into more depth to review:

        <h2>Completion</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Two card backs with interesting patterns created.</li>
          <li>
            SCSS has been used where appropriate. (variables for colors or sizes
            would be a good start)
          </li>
          <li>Both backs use at least 3-4 shapes.</li>
          <li>
            Some sort of SVG grouping has been used (g, pattern, symbol, etc).
          </li>
          <li>CSS has been used to style some portion of the SVG.</li>
