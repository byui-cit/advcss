            Imagine you have been asked to help move a printed textbook online.
            You are provided with a text file that contains the
            <a href="../examples/lpic-page126.txt">text from an example page</a
            >, and an image of that page in the textbook. (see below)
          </p>
          <div class="fig-block">
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../images/lpic-pg126.jpeg"
                alt="sample textbook page"
              />
            </figure>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>Recreate the textbook example provided in a webpage format, using html and font styles in css. Typography is important.
        </p>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will have convert the provided text file to semantic
          HTML, and then produce the CSS (or SCSS) to format it in an attractive
          and readable way while still honoring the layout and look and feel
          from the printed page.
        </p>

        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <!-- Start step -->
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>
              Convert the
              <a href="../examples/lpic-page126.txt">provided text </a> from the
              book into well structured semantic HTML. Pay attention to the
              image to see which text will need to be emphasized in some way.
              Make sure your HTML allows for this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep in mind re-usability as well as you structure your markup. We
              hope to write as few CSS rules as possible, and re-use as many as
              we can to accomplish the styling.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Start step -->
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>
              Style the text. Refer to the image often, and make sure to keep in
              mind the principles introduced in the prepare and ponder portions
              of this module. (ie measure, flow, scale, whitespace, etc)
            </p>
            <p>
              If you look closely at the image, you will see several different
              font stylings going on. We have san-serif, serif, mono-spaced,
              bold, and italics. Normally you would require multiple font faces
              to accomplish this. If we want to use custom fonts this could add
              up to 5-6 different font files to load!
            </p>
            <p>
              For this activity we are going to try and represent all of the
              different font stylings using one font. This will be much easier
              if you use a variable font such as the
              <a href="https://www.recursive.design/">Recursive font</a>
              used earlier in the Ponder activity for this activity.
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
              Variable fonts are cool, and seeing lots of attention
              currently...but they are not always the right answer. This
              activity could certainly be accomplished without a variable font.
              You are asked to use one primarily to get more practice at using
              them.

          <li>
            <!-- Start step -->
            <h3>Alert</h3>
            <p>
              For the Alert graphics you can start by just surrounding the word
              'Alert' with a round border. We can do more however. Spend some
              time to experiment with other things. You could either see how
              close you can get with CSS to the image in the book, or come up
              with your own version that accomplishes the same thing...to draw
              attention to something important! In this case a tip to help the
              reader do better on the exam that the book is preparing them for.
