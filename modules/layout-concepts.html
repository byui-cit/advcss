        <p>
          This activity is a little different than most of the others. It
          provides preparation for all the other Layout modules, and as such
          will have no Prove portion of it's own. It will instead send you off
          to complete another layout module to get more depth in one aspect of
          layout. Count this module finished when you have completed the
          reading, then go do another Layout module as a followup.
        </p>

          You will notice some overlap and repetition in these resources. Much
          of it might feel like review. This is intentional. There are some
          important key concepts presented here that are critical to understand.
          Hopefully reading about them from multiple different sources will help
          them to settle in your brain.
