          <p>
            The last few years have been really exciting for web
            designers/developers. With the arrival and support for things like
            Flexbox, CSS Grid, and others we finally have not just good...but
            great tools to accomplish our layouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly things that were not possible (or at least things that
            involved a lot of pain to do) are not only possible but in some
            cases easy to do. It's time to get out of ruts and experiment with
            these new tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of that being said, it is also important to develop good
            foundational skills building traditional designs. This activity is
            designed to both encourage us to look forward to new possibilities
            in Web Design, and make sure that we have the core skills necessary
            to move ourselves and our designs forward.

            <h3>Review the design</h3>
            <p>
              For the rest of this exercise we will be re-building the BYU-Idaho
              Home page. Begin by familiarizing yourself with the page and how
              it responds at different screen widths. Because of time
              constraints we will be excluding certain parts of the page and
              making a few small changes. See the screenshots below for more
              details.

                First we are going to simplify the header. We are going to keep
                the mobile header on all layouts. You will also not be required
                to make the buttons in the menu work. We just don't have time
                this week.
              </li>
              <li>
                Second, we will end our page right after the Taylor building
                image. The large blue and black footers will not be required.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pay attention to the details of the page. This assignment is
                very much about details!

              Consider this design through the lens of the component based
              design introduced in the Atomic design chapter. How many
              components do you see? I counted three different ones.

            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <p>
              Download <a href="../../resources/byui-home.zip">this code</a> and
              open it in your editor to get started. It contains an html file
              with the HTML for the header, and some SCSS files with some
              helpful things. Review these files before moving on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pay particular attention to the code in the
              <kbd>_icons.scss</kbd> file. All of the icons on the site are
              pulled from a font file. This is a common practice. This partial
              contains the CSS to allow you to pull each icon out and use it.
              You can see an example of this in the provided header code:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;a href="#"&gt;
    &lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="icon-byui-logo"&gt;
        &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Link to BYU-Idaho home page&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>
              Note the <code>class="icon-byui-logo</code> on the span. This
              class will go find the right icon in the font and display it using
              a <code>::before</code> pseudo element.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pay close attention as well to the other properties in this
              snippet. <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> and
              <code>class="sr-only"</code>. You will see more of that as you
              look through the provided code. Both of these work together to
              improve the accessability of the site to visually impaired
              visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> is a note to the screen reader to
              ignore this element. It makes sense...it is purely decorative and
              there is nothing read, but it would be nice to know that there was
              a logo...so the span with the <code>sr-only</code> class contains
              a message that should not be visible, but only read if a visitor
              has a screen reader...in fact if you look at the SCSS provided you
              will see that rule. It goes to great lengths to make sure that any
              element is <strong>does not</strong> show up for anything but
              <kbd>s</kbd>creen <kbd>r</kbd>eaders <kbd>only</kbd>. (this
              particular version of that rule was borrowed from Bootstrap)
            </p>
            <p>
              As you write your HTML pay attention to accessability! If there
              are any elements that cannot be understood as read...add some
              <code>sr-only</code> notes to help visitors out. These elements
              can likewise be removed from the screen reader's queue with the
              <code>aria-hidden</code> property, making your pages easier and
              quicker to navigate with readers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Start your work by styling the header and nav to match the BYUI at
              a mobile size. Then adjust it for larger desktops as discussed
              above.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you style put some thought and planning into the naming and
              structure of your SCSS as well. See if you can apply the
              principles from a CSS architecture like
              <a href="http://getbem.com/introduction/" target="_blank">BEM</a>
              for example.
            </p>

          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Component Design</h3>
            <p>
              Continue your work on this site by writing the HTML for the three
              components discussed above. Have a goal of keeping your HTML
              markup as simple as possible, while focusing on re-use by adding
              classes to each one. Something like
              <a href="http://getbem.com/introduction/">BEM</a> would work great
              here to help you to intelligently name your classes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ideally you should be able to take the HTML you wrote for one of
              the components, copy/paste it and replace the content (text and/or
              image src) while leaving the HTML and CSS the same. Sometimes you
              will have slight changes to one instance of a module, in that case
              you might have a modifier class or two.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example there are two versions of the list of links...one with
              a a grey header , and one with blue header. The rest of the
              styling is the same...so you might do something like this with
              your SCSS:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">
.list-links {
    &__header {
      // base styling for the component...with grey header.
      &--blue {
        // code to change the header to be blue
      }
    }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>(This would compile to this:)</p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">
  .list-links__header {
       // base styling for the component...with grey header.
  }
  .list-links__header--blue {
          // code to change the header to be blue
  }
  </code></pre>
            <p>
              Add the additional class to the appropriate instance of your
              component.
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>

          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Finish the HTML</h3>
            <p>
              Once you have the HTML for your components built, write the rest
              of the HTML for the page to account for all of the content. Re-use
              the component code as appropriate. You should use the images and
              text currently on the site.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                While it is fine to look at the HTML for the actual site for
                inspiration while completing this step, resist the temptation to
                just copy/paste large parts of it. The HTML on the actual is
                quite a bit more complex than we really need it to be and using
                much of it will most likely end up taking you more time than if
                you just wrote the HTML from scratch by yourself.
              </p>
              <p>
                You should think ahead a little as well while writing your HTML.
                Consider how you think you might accomplish the layout of the
                site as well (Flexbox or Grid). Make sure that your flex/grid
                items are all grouped together under the right flex/grid
                containers.
              </p>

            <h5>Check your site with the WAVE tool</h5>
            <p>
              Once you have the HTML written, run your page through the
              <a href="https://wave.webaim.org">WAVE tool</a> to see if it finds
              any serious issues with the accessibility of your HTML. Fix your
