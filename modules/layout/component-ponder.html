            Websites are often just collections of pieces called components.
            Treating them this way helps us to write more re-usable code. It
            also can help reduce the complexity of redesigns. This activity will
            go through the process of designing and creating a reusable web
            component.

            <h3>Review BEM.</h3>
            <p>
              One issue we run into very early on with components is that CSS
              has global scope. What this means is that all CSS is visible
              EVERYWHERE! For something like a component that is designed to be
              reusable this can cause problems. You might include the component
              into the HTML and CSS and find out that you had the same class
              names in the component that you had in the existing CSS and
              something breaks.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSS naming conventions are designed to help with the global nature
              of CSS. One popular convention is called BEM - Block, Element,
              Modifier. If you did not complete the Architecture and
              Organization Module take a few minutes to familiarize yourself
              with
              <a href="http://getbem.com/introduction/" target="_blank"
                >BEM's basic conventions</a
              >.

            <p>
              Below is a screenshot of the component we would like to build. It
              is a simple article summary that you might find on a typical blog.
              Review it considering how the HTML should be structured, and how
              you might layout and name the different blocks and elements.

            <h3>Identify blocks and elements</h3>
            <p>
              Our component is made up of the following elements:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>An image</li>
              <li>A list of tags</li>
              <li>Title</li>
              <li>Date</li>
              <li>A short lead in to the article.</li>
              <li>A link to continue to the article.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              As we write our HTML we should keep semantics in mind as we choose
              our HTML tags, as well as the tenets of BEM as we determine
              classes

            <h3>Write the HTML</h3>
            <p>
              Create a new file in your editor, or Codepen and attempt to write
              the HTML complete with appropriate classes. Then return and check
              out the instructor's solution below.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;article class="summary"&gt;
    &lt;img
        class="summary__img"
        src="http://via.placeholder.com/320x240"
        alt="post image"
    /&gt;

    &lt;div class="summary__body"&gt;
        &lt;p class="summary__tags"&gt;Tags&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2 class="summary__title"&gt;Title of Post&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p class="summary__date"&gt;Feb 20&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="summary__para"&gt;
        This is a wider card with supporting text below as a natural lead-in
        to additional content.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="summary__link"&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Continue Reading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>Notice a few things about the code above.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                First, this is not the only way to code this up. You may have
                differences in your code, and that is ok. You may have decided
                that a <code>section</code> would be a better wrapper than an
                <code>article for example</code>, and you may be right ;)
              </li>
              <li>
                Second notice that almost everything has a class on it. We start
                with our block class <kbd>summary</kbd> at the top, and then we
                name the elements. You might be saying to yourself "why don't I
                just use complex selectors and get rid of half of those
                classes?" If we are using a naming convention like BEM (and for
                this activity we should be), it specifies that we should not use
                element selectors in our CSS. The only way to avoid that is to
                use lots of classes. This is one of the biggest complaints most
                folks have with BEM...but it turns out that as projects become
                larger and more complex consistently adopting a naming
                convention like this makes the code much much easier to maintain
                over time.
              </li>
              <li>
                One word in favor of having classes on everything. It makes it
                really easy to differentiate between all of those paragraph
                elements, and it makes it clear in the HTML what content is
                contained in each element. They also provide nice hooks if we
                were using this as a template for a bunch of articles coming
                from a database. Getting the right information into each element
                becomes easy...and things won't break if a someone decides to
                re-order and re-style things without talking to anyone!
              </li>
              <li>
                This markup will also lend itself well to both our small and
                large screen views. For the small screen view in fact we will
                need very little positioning.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <!-- Step End -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Style</h3>
            <p>
              Add the CSS (SCSS if you have completed that module) to style the
              mobile view first. Then add whatever media queries you need to
              make the design responsive. Pay attention to padding, margins,
              font-sizes, placement, etc. You can just use
              <kbd>helvetica, arial, san-serif</kbd> for the font.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                If you are using SCSS you have a great tool to help you manage
                your BEM naming: nesting. Here is an example of how that might
                work:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-css">
.summary {
  box-shadow: 1px 1px 4px 1px #888;
  border-radius: 3px;
  max-width: 360px;
  &__title {
    margin-bottom: 0;
  }
  &__img {
    width: 100%;
  }
  &__body {
    padding: 1em;
  }
  &__tags {
    color: blue;
    font-weight: bold;
    margin: 0;
  }
  &__date {
    color: grey;
    margin-top: 0.3em;
  }
  &__link a {
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
              </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
              As you can see, the CSS to create the mobile layout is quite
              simple, and it really won't take us too many more lines to
              complete it.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">
@media screen and (min-width: 440px) {
  .summary {
    display: flex;
    max-width: 500px;
  }
  .summary__img {
    width: 40%;
    order: 2;
  }
}
            </code></pre>
            <!-- Step End -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Next steps</h3>
            <p>
              At this point we would be prepared to use our component in a
              single or multiple layouts. We would simply copy/paste the
              template and fill in with real content. The arrangment of the
              components is up to the layout they are placed in. The component
              is only concerned with what happens inside of it...not out. It
              might look something like this:
            </p>
            <!-- Step End -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Submit in Ilearn</h3>
            <p>
              Submit the codepen url to Ilearn.
            </p>
            <!-- Step End -->
          </li>
