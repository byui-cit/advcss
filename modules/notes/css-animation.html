        <h2>Why animation?</h2>
        <p>
          I would begin by reviewing the
          <a
            href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/guide-css-layout/"
            target="_blank"
            >Material Design animation clip</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h2>History of Animation</h2>
        <p>
          Talk briefly about animation principles: keyframes, in between frames
          (tweens). An animation is really just taking a change from a beginning
          keyfrmae to and ending keyframe and have it happen over time instead
          of instantly.

          >.
        </p>
        <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
        <p>
          I usually just use these
          <a href="https://codepen.io/matkat/pen/EKaNZg" target="_blank"
            >boxes</a
          >
          to demo. Start by transitioning the red box doubling in size. Use SCSS
          where appropriate. <code>transition</code> property goes in the base
          state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have the students work out making one of the boxes move left and
          disappear. Talk about what they tried, bring up that not all
          properties are animatable.
        </p>
        <h2>Animations</h2>
        <p>
          If we want to do something more complex like a bouncing ball, we need
          more than transition. Animations allow for multiple keyframes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Demo bouncing ball. Make sure to bring up that the entire state for
          each keyframe need to be defined...you need to specify what should
          stay the same...as well as what should change.
