        <h2>CSS Layout</h2>
        <p>
          I would begin by reviewing the
          <a
            href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/guide-css-layout/"
            target="_blank"
            >Smashing magazine Layout article</a
          >. Make sure the students understand Normal flow. Then talk about
          <code>position</code>. This layout technique is often highly
          discouraged...mainly because beginning students use it wrong! Make
          sure they understand how the coordinate systems work...ie position
          absolute coordinates will be top/left corner of first non-static
          ancestor.
        </p>
        <p>
          This opens us up to understand how to appropriately use
          position:absolute. It should almost always be used inside of a
          position: relative container.
        </p>

        <h2>Grids</h2>
        <p>
          Move on to grids...talk about how there is some confusion because
          'grid' is overused as a word in CSS. It could be used to refer to
          'designing to a grid', a 'grid library', or 'CSS grid'. Three related
          but different things. Review
          <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/grid-theory/" target="_blank"
            >this grid theory article</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Which one should I use!?</h2>
        <p>
          It depends :) But most of the time now your layouts should be a
          combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox. If you run into a layout problem
          where they don't work, then look at the others...
        </p>
        <h2>Intrinsic designs</h2>
        <p>
          Finally spend a bit of time discussing the contents of the Jen Simmons
          presentation:
          <a
            href="https://aneventapart.com/news/post/designing-intrinsic-layouts-aea-video"
            target="_blank"
            >Designing Intrinsic Layouts</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In earlier courses students are taught that fixed units are bad. They
          should not use px to determine spacing for example because it's not
          responsive. Sometimes however this causes problems, columns that are
          too large or too small...or both! Sometimes it's OK when we know how
          big something should be to just make it that big. Then you handle
          responsiveness through the rest of the page. Jen simmons calls this
          mix of fixed and responsive elements in a layout Intrisic Design.

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="../../resources/VignelliCanon.pdf">VignelliCanon</a> (pdf)
            Document produced by Massimo Vignelli, a well known designer. Has a
            great section on the importance of grids.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="../../resources/06_JenSimmons.pdf"
              >Getting out of our ruts - Jen Simmons</a
            >. Notes from a talk by Jen Simmons. Good examples of how most of
            the layouts we tend to see are variations of the same thing...rows
            of information that wrap, or columns that wrap. Page 24 particularly
            hits home.
