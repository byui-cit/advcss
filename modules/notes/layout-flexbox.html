        <h2>CSS Flexbox fundamentals</h2>
        <p>
          Flexbox is all about one dimensional flows. We have great control over
          one direction (or axis) but not so much on the other. If we need exact
          placement along both directions...then Flexbox is not what we need. A
          large number of websites fit within this however. You could reference
          the Jen Simmons notes below for examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          I always start with boxes:
          <a href="https://codepen.io/matkat/pen/EKaNZg" target="_blank"
            >Boxes codepen</a
          >. It's helpful to pull up the
          <a
            href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"
            target="_blank"
            >CSS Tricks: Guide to Flexbox</a
          >
          for reference. I work down the Parent side first, then down the child.
          Understanding primary/secondary Axis, and alignment tends to be the
          trickiest for students to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Justify always affects the primary axis, Align always affects the
          secondary axis.

            >MDN: Box Alignment in Flexbox</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          With Children understanding the <code>flex</code> property tends to be
          the hardest. I often intentionally stop using the abbreviated
          <code>flex</code>, and instead break it down into
          <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>, and
          <code>flex-basis</code> until students understand what each part does.
        </p>

        <h2>Practice</h2>
        <p>
          The activity has the students do some exercises in MDN. You could also
          spend some time working through something like this
          <a href="../examples/card-layout/index.html" target="_blank"
            >Tile example</a
          >
          with the students.
        </p>
        <p>
          They will need some boilerplate to get started...here is the link:
          <a href="../examples/card-layout/Archive.zip">Code Archive</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <ul>

            <a href="../../resources/06_JenSimmons.pdf"
              >Getting out of our ruts - Jen Simmons</a
            >. Notes from a talk by Jen Simmons. Good examples of how most of
            the layouts we tend to see are variations of the same thing...rows
            of information that wrap, or columns that wrap. Page 24 particularly
            hits home.
