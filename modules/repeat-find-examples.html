        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          The web is a rapidly evolving platform. CSS changes regularly and the
          ways that it is used in building web sites change as well. Over the
          first week of the semester you need to pay close attention to every
          website you visit. Take note of anything that catches your attention.
          You are looking for things that the builder of the site has done that
          you think are cool and that you would be interested in learning how to
          replicate. Essentially anything that causes you to think "I wonder how
          they did that?" should get recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compile your ideas together you generate the following information
          about each:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>URL of the site</li>
          <li>
            Screenshot and description of the element you are interested in
          </li>
          <li>
            List of CSS topics you think will be involved in recreating the
            example
          </li>
          <li>A time estimate for completing the example</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          By the end of the week you should have gathered 3 examples. At that
          time submit the links to your examples here in ILearn. Try to find
          different types of examples, ie:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Layouts that you think are unique or clever or that you just want to
            know how to accomplish
          </li>
          <li>A reusable component (a part of a page)</li>
          <li>Animations</li>
          <li>A creative take on a form or form input.</li>
          <li>etc...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          During weeks 2-4 you will complete as many of your examples as you
          can. You should complete at least one of them, but hopefully will
          complete 2-3 of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we begin working on the examples it is important to remember a few
          things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The purpose of these exercises is to <strong>learn</strong>. Do not
            let concerns about doing it wrong or right get in the way of your
            learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your instructor should provide initial feedback in your
            deconstructing of the problem and identifying topics you may need to
            study in order to be successful. You will be expected to find
            resources on your own as needed to solve the problems. When you find
            a good helpful resource
            <strong>please share it with your classmates!</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Be prepared to <span class="strike">fail</span>
            <em>have our goals and expectations change</em>. We may not succeed
            in replicating each example we attempt. This is ok as long as we
            learn something from each attempt.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is the first outcome of the course, and the most important.
            <strong>Learn how to Learn</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Progress reports</h2>
        <p>
          Each week you should complete the weekly reflection with a report
          about the progress you have made and whether you have questions.
        </p>
        <h2>Finishing an example</h2>
        <p>
          Each time you finish an example you should spend some time writing a
          <strong>detailed</strong> reflection of what you learned.
