        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
          If you are taking the course for the second time, the way you spend
          weeks 5-12 can vary. You have a few options:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            First, if the class chooses a module which you have not completed
            you should work on that module with the rest of the class.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the class chooses a module for the week that you have already
            completed, but you feel that you did not gain the mastery of that
            topic that you wanted the first time around, then you have the
            option of studying that topic on your own to learn more. You should
            make a specific goal or two, and should decide on an activity that
            you will complete and turn in to the instructor to show that you
            have met your goals.
          </li>
          <li>
            You also have the option of choosing a different module from the
            class if they pick one you have already done.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, you could work similarly to w1-4, where you find a site
            with something on it that you are interested in and spend your time
            learning how to replicate that thing.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong
            >You should communicate your decision on how you will spend your
            time each week to the instructor before the week begins!</strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will report on your efforts for each week using the same
          reflection as the rest of the class.
        </p>
