        <h1>Required Module: Zen Garden, Finishing up</h1>
        <p>Hours: 6</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Prepare</h2>
        <p>
          Make sure to have completed the
          <a href="req-zen-1.html" target="_blank">Zen Garden part 1</a> module
          before this.
        </p>

        <h2>Ponder</h2>
        <p>Review the project requirements:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Your Zen Garden version should follow a theme.</li>
          <li>
            You need to follow the Zen Garden guidelines. They are all outlined
            in the content on the page (You read that right?) You must have
            rights to any media you use. I would actually recommend that you try
            and produce all your graphics with either CSS or SVG. (This means
            don’t spend a lot of time creating art. Keep it simple). Remember
            also that you are not allowed to modify the html…so any imagery you
            add has to be in the css.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Zen Garden guidelines do not require responsiveness, I do. Your
            final product must be responsive.
          </li>
          <li>
            This should represent your <em>best</em> work and should try to
            incorporate many of the topics studied the semester. A minimal
            effort here will not get top scores.
          </li>
          <li>
            All the CSS must be your own work. Libraries are great at times…but
            this is not one of them.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Prove</h2>
        <p>
          Complete your Zen Garden Site. This is <strong>not</strong> due until
          the end of the course and you will have time during the last week of
          the course to work on this.
          <strong
            >If you do nothing until then, however, you will struggle to produce
            quality work</strong
          >. Coordinate with your teams to make some progress each week.
        </p>
        <p>Once done the group should submit the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The names of all members of the group,</li>
          <li>
            a description of the theme you have chosen and ideas about how you
            will incorporate it into your design,
          </li>
          <li>
            a mention of which topics the group included in their project from
            the course modules,
          </li>
          <li>
            either a URL where your project can be seen <strong>or</strong> an
            archive of your files.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Each group should also be prepared to present their project. Your
          instructor will let you know if that will be in synchronous (meeting
          in class or online) or asynchonous (a video).
        </p>

        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Final project follows the Zen Garden guidelines (read the content of
            your page if you have forgotten what these are).
          </li>
          <li>
            Final project makes good use of the proposed theme and shows
            attention to detail.
          </li>
          <li>
            Project includes examples of many of the topics from the modules
            available for the course.
          </li>
          <li>Final project is responsive.</li>
          <li>SCSS is used and the file is provided.</li>
          <li>Compiled css is valid.</li>
        </ul>
