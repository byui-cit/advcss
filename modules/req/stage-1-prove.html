          <p>
            By now you should have formed groups and picked a theme (ex: an
            idea, a movie, or repeating concepts) that you will use for your
            version of the CSS Style Stage. You should have reviewed the content
            and prepared a couple of wireframes as well, making sure to include
            everything. This activity will have you continue your work on this
            project by continuing your planning for your version of the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            The readings on
            <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/cube-css/">CUBE CSS</a>
            that you were asked to read presented an idea about structuring your
            CSS. As projects become larger and more complex, structuring the CSS
            becomes more and more important. The project that we used as a
            started already had some structuring, and while we can tease some of
            the CUBE CSS principles out, there are others that are missing.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>
          Re-structure the SCSS files in the Style Stage starter to better apply
          the principles from CUBE CSS. You should also take the opportunity to
          remove all of the CSS that we will not need so that we can start with
          more of a clean state. This activity is intended to be completed as a
          team!
        </p>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Create a team copy of the starter repo</h3>
            <p>
              One person on the team should log in to Github, then visit this
              <a href="https://github.com/5t3ph/stylestage-sass">Github repo</a
              >. There should be a green button that says "Use this Template".
              If you do not see this, check to make sure you are signed in!
            </p>
            <p>
              Clicking that button will create a copy of the repository in your
              account. Next the rest of the group must be given access. Goto
              Settings->Collaborators, then send an invite to the github account
              of each team member.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team memebers should check their email for the invite and
              accept it. Then each team member should clone the repo to their
              computer. The easiest way to do this would be to open VS Code,
              then goto File->New Window, then on the page that opens select the
              "Clone a Git Repository". If you have your Github account already
              connected to VS Code you should be able to search for the repo,
              otherwise you can goto github.com and get the URL for the repo to
              clone instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you are done, all team members should have the same
              repository cloned to their computers. You could at this point run
              Sass like we learned earlier:
              <code>sass style.scss:style.css</code>, but we do have another
              option as well.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <h3>Using a task manager and build tools</h3>

              <p>
                The project we copied actually had some utilities included with
                it that we can use to automatically do things like view the page
                in a local webserver, and compile our SCSS each time we save. In
                order to use these tools we have one more step we need to take.
                Each team member will need to run a command in the command line.
                (In VS Code you can open a terminal window by pressing 'ctrl/CMD
                + ~'). The command you want to run is <kbd>npm install</kbd>. If
                you get an error you should go back and check the
                <a href="../../lesson01/l01-software.html">software setup</a>
                again and make sure you got NodeJs installed and working.
              </p>
              <p>
                To work on the project you will need to run another command.
                <kbd>npm run start</kbd>. This will start a web server, and a
                SCSS compiler! When you are done working to shut down the server
                click into the terminal window and press 'ctrl+c'
              </p>
              <p>You may be asking yourself a couple of questions:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  How did the <kbd>npm install</kbd> command know what to
                  install?
                </li>
                <li>...and why <kbd>npm run start</kbd>?</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The answers to both of those questions can be found in a file in
                our project: <kbd>package.json</kbd>. Open that now and look
                through it. There are two sections of interest: scripts, and
                dependencies
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-json">"dependencies": {
  "browser-sync": "^2.26.3",
  "npm-run-all": "^4.1.5",
  "sass": "^1.26.10"
}</code></pre>
              <pre><code class="lang-json">"scripts": {
  "scss": "sass --no-source-map sass:public",
  "watch": "sass --no-source-map --watch sass:public",
  "serve": "browser-sync start --server public --files public --port 1337",
  "start": "npm-run-all scss --parallel watch serve"
},</code></pre>
              <p>
                The dependencies section was used when we ran
                <kbd>npm install</kbd>. That section tells npm what packages it
                needs to download. The scripts section makes different commands
                available...for example we could run <kbd>npm run watch</kbd> or
                <kbd>npm run scss</kbd> or the one that we did run:
                <kbd>npm run start</kbd>. That command actually runs the
                <kbd>serve</kbd> script and the <kbd>watch</kbd> script
                together!
              </p>

            <p>
              Review the <a href="https://cube.fyi">CUBE CSS principles</a>
              again. You were asked to watch one of the videos in the Examples
              section, ther others are good as well. Feel free to watch another
              if you feel you need more help understanding the principles or how
              to apply them.

            <h3>Apply CUBE</h3>
            <p>
              Discuss with your team the best way you might apply the principles
              of CUBE CSS to this project.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                As you begin your discussion, it would be helpful to look
                closely at the existing files in the Sass folder. Most of the
                files correspond to blocks, or sections of the page. If we
                follow the CUBE CSS recommendations we could start by
                categorizing all of the existing files as one of four things:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Global CSS</li>
                <li>Composition related styles</li>
                <li>Block related styles</li>
                <li>Utility styles</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <p>
              One person on the team should create four folders inside of the
              <kbd>sass</kbd> directory. One for each of the things listed
              above. Begin placing the .scss files into one of our new folders.
              (You will find that most of the existing files will go into the
              'blocks' folder)
            </p>
            <p>
              What about utilities? Most of the time a utility class should do
              one thing, and one thing only, and would be used by adding the
              class to whatever element(s) we want that change applied to. We
              have a slight problem however...we can't modify the HTML to add
              utility classes! How can we work around this?
              <code>@mixin</code>!
            </p>
            <p>
              The same person that has been moving files should also fix the
              <kbd>styles.scss</kbd> file. We just changed all the paths to the
              partials! for example you may need to take the line that reads
              <code>@import "theme";</code> and change it to
              <code>@import "global/theme";</code> (this assumes you created a
              folder called global and moved the _theme.scss file into that
              folder)
            </p>
            <!-- Step End -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Choose colors and fonts</h3>
            <p>
              As a team think for a moment about colors that might work well
              with your theme. Open up the <kbd>_theme.scss</kbd> file and
              update it with some new colors. Make sure the SCSS compiles
              correctly, then check the page to see if your colors show up. You
              might also do the same with some fonts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you have made sure that the changes are coming through your
              team should go through and remove the CSS from most of the sass
              partials. The CSS that is in there is to make the default
              page...we want a clean slate. You can keep the contents of the
              <kbd>_theme</kbd> and <kbd>_reset</kbd> files if you wish...but
              most of the others should probably be cleared out. I would
              recommend to keep the files, but just clear out the contents.
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
              How many SCSS partials should you have in your project? There is
              no right number actually, but when working in a team on a project
              having the code split between lots of files can actually make it
              easier for you to work without stepping on each others toes. I
              recommend using LOTS of partials!

          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Commit and share your changes</h3>
            <p>
              Once you have everything working again, the driver should commit
              all the changes, then push them to Github. After that the rest of
              the team should do a pull to get the changes. As you work you
              should get in the habit to always 'pull' before you do anything
              else!
