            <h3>Pick a Theme</h3>
            <p>
               One of the things that
              you will notice about the good Zen Garden submissions is that they
              have a theme. Some idea that they build around. This is your first
              task as a group is to determine what theme your version will have.
              Pick something that you will get excited about working with.

            <h3>Review Zen Garden Content</h3>
            <p>
              <p>
                 After choosing your
                theme you should also spend some time this week familiarizing
                yourselves with the content of the Zen Garden. Download the
                <a href="http://csszengarden.com/examples/index" target="_blank"
                  >html</a
                >
                and
                <a href="http://csszengarden.com/examples/style.css" target="_blank"
                  >starter css</a
                >
                and review it un-styled. Then look through 10-15 examples of what
                others have done.
              </p>
            </p>

            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Review Guidelines </h3>
            <p>
              <p>
                With your theme in mind,
                and the content reviewed, keep in mind a few restrictions that I am placing on
                you:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  You need to follow the Zen Garden guidelines. They are all outlined
                  in the content on the page (You read that right?) You must have
                  rights to any media you use. I would actually recommend that you try
                  and produce all your graphics with either CSS or SVG. (This means
                  don’t spend a lot of time creating art. Keep it simple). Remember
                  also that you are not allowed to modify the html…so any imagery you
                  add has to be in the css.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This should represent your <em>best</em> work and should try to
                  incorporate many of the topics studied the semester. A minimal
                  effort here will not get top scores.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Zen Garden guidelines do not require responsiveness, I do. Your
                  final product must be responsive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All the CSS must be your own work. Libraries are great at times…but
                  this is not one of them.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  If you are worried about #1, here are a few examples of some
                  versions that keep the art simple and yet are very effective.

            <h3>Create Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              <p>
                 After choosing your
                theme and reviewing the guidelines and a few examples your next task
                is to produce wireframes. You should have a minimum of 2: a large
                screen version and a small screen version. I recommend layout out your
                wireframes using the principle of grids. See this:
                <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/grid-theory/" target="_blank"
                  >Grid Theory</a
                >
                for more details on what that is.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                There are dozens of tools you can use to produce wireframe. I don't
                have a strong opinion about what you use to produce yours. Image
                editors if you have access can do a good job, online tools like
                <a href="http://wireframe.cc" target="_blank">wireframe.cc</a> and
                others are free and specifically for this. I've even seen wireframes
                produced in presentation software (ie Powerpoint, Keynote). My only
                requirement is that you can get it to me as a .png, .jpg, or .pdf.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since we have all of the actual content it would be a shame to not
                take advantage of it. It will allow you to save the right amount of
                space for each section and to make sure that each section is accounted
                for.

            <h3>Submit</h3>
            <p>
              Once done one person in
              the group should submit a document (.txt, .doc, or .html) that
              contains the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The names of all members of the group,</li>
              <li>
                a description of the theme you have chosen and ideas about how you
                will incorporate it into your design,
              </li>
              <li>
                and images of at least 2 wireframes. (If you have used something
                like wireframe.cc that you can share a link with...you can just add
                the link instead of a file to your wireframes)
              </li>
            </ol>
            <!-- Step End -->
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        

        
        
        
        <h2>Completion</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Theme outlined and thought seems to have been given about the
            implementation of the theme.
          </li>
          <li>At least 2 wireframes included.</li>
          <li>
            Wireframes take into account all of the content from the Zen Garden
            html file.
