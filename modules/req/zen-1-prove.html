          <p>
            By now you should have formed groups and picked a theme that you
            will use for your version of the CSS Zen Garden. You should have
            reviewed the content and prepared a couple of wireframes as well,
            making sure to include everything. This activity will have you
            continue your work on this project by continuing your planning for
            your version of the site.

            The chapter from
            <a href="https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-1/"
              >Atomic Design</a
            >
            that you were asked to read presented the idea that there is a lot
            of merit in approaching web pages or sites as collections of
            components...modular design. It then goes further and proposes
            applying structure and documentation through the creation of a
            detailed vocabulary and of a style guide or pattern library as part
            of the development process.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should approach your design of your Zen Garden site from this
            direction.

            <h3>Read Atomic Design Ch2</h3>
            <p>

            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Identify parts</h3>
            <p>
              Go back and review a few different versions of the Zen Garden.
              Identify and make a list of the different atoms, molecules, and
              organisms that you see. As you switch versions watch for patterns
              and use them to help you identify the parts.

            <h3>Apply your theme</h3>
            <p>
              With the list from the previous step, review your chosen theme and
              start thinking about how you will adapt your it to style the
              atoms, molecules, and organisms identified in the previous step.
            </p>
            <!-- Step End -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Begin a Styleguide/pattern library</h3>
            <p>
              You should complete the
              <a href="../tech_scss.html" target="_blank"
                >Preprocessors Module</a
              >
              before continuing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Begin your styleguide by creating a few scss files. Let's create
              one for <code>atoms</code>, one for <code>molecules</code>, and
              one for <code>organisms</code> to start. Then create a file called
              <kbd>style.scss</kbd>. This will be your main scss file for the
              project. We need to bring all of these files together so they can
              be seen by our page.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                <a
                  href="https://sass-lang.com/blog/the-module-system-is-launched"
                  target="_blank"
                  >SCSS modules</a
                >
                will work great for this. It would look something like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-css">// styles.scss
@use 'atoms';  // assumes file is named _atoms.scss
@use 'molecules';
@use 'organisms' as o;  // can shorten the name if we like :)
              </code></pre>
            </div>

            <!-- Step End -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Choose colors and fonts</h3>
            <p>
              Give some thought to your color scheme and fonts. Consider your
              theme as you do this.
            </p>
            <p>
              Create another SCSS module called <kbd>_variables.scss</kbd>. Add
              variables to that file with your chosen colors and fonts.
            </p>
            <!-- Step End -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- Step Start -->
            <h3>Create atoms</h3>
            <p>
              Create at least 5 atoms for your project. These should be for base
              styling for your version of the Zen Garden. For example take a
              look at the
              <a
                href="http://csszengarden.com/217/"
                rel="noreferrer"
                target="_blank"
                >Screen Filler version</a
              >
              of the Zen Garden. The H1 has a definate style. That would become
              one of your atoms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also in the header we have a couple of paragraphs that are all
              uppercase. That set of styles is used at least three times in the
              design. I would add a mixin to create that look. Look for a
              similar opportunity to use mixins in your plans.
            </p>

            <h3>Review this example</h3>
            <p>
              Using the Zen version mentioned above here is an example of how
              your style guide/pattern library could come together using SCSS.
              Review it and make adjustments to yours as necessary.
              <a href="./zen-style/pattern.html" target="_blank"
                >Pattern library example</a
              >. Here is a
              <a href="zen-style.zip">link to the source SCSS files</a> for the
              example.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that this is just one way to structure this. In a more
              complete Atomic implementation you might see many atom files.
              Sometimes as many as one file per atom. Feel free to experiment
              with this. As you are working with a group to complete this
              assignment you might find that more SCSS modules will make your
              job easier than just one or two.
