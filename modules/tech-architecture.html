              >Become the CSS Hero of Your Office with CSS Architecture</a
            >. The whole course is good, but quite long (2h34m). I would
            recommend watching the first two lessons, then pick at least 2-3
            parts from lesson 3 to watch. If you have completed the
            <a href="./tech-debugging.html">Tech Debugging</a> module you should
            already have watched section 2.1, if not watch it here.

        </ol>
        <h2>Prove</h2>
        <p>
          Earlier in the course you were asked to learn about Atomic design and
          implement it in the Style Guide you created for your ZenGarden
          project. Atomic design is one architectural design philosophy. The CSS
          Architecture course we began above will introduce another one:
          <a
            href="https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >ITCSS</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Both are valid, but take different approaches to the problem of
          organizing CSS. Complete Lesson 5 in the Sitepoint CSS Architecture
          course to see ITCSS in action. As you do, think back to what you
          learned about Atomic CSS...how do they compare? Which do you prefer?
          Develop an opinion!
