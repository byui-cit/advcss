        <h1>CSS Utilities</h1>

        <hr />
        <p>The web community has created a lot of very useful tools to help you analyze, debug, and optimize your CSS.  Many of them are simple command line utilities that run on Node. This activity will give you practice in using some of these tools.</p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            At the beginning of the semester you were asked to install several
            utilities, many of which we haven't discussed yet. Lets do
            that now. You have been learning about debugging and optimization
            this week through your readings, lets take a few minutes and explore
            those tools to see how they might help with those goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            This will put us back at the command line typing in commands...you
            may need to review the
            <a href="../resources/cmd-line-mac.html" target="_blank"
              >command line mac</a
            >
            or
            <a href="../resources/cmd-line-pc.html" target="_blank"
              >command line pc</a
            >
            resources. You will need to be comfortable changing directories to
            succeed with this activity.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>
          Make sure to have
          <a
            href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/css-master-2nd-edition/read/2"
            target="_blank"
            >CSS Master: Ch2. Debugging and Optimization</a
          >
          open to refer to during this activity. It has usage instructions for
          the some of the utilities we will be looking at here.
        </p>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
                <!-- start step-->
                <h3>stylelint</h3>
                <p>
                   Open up the command line
                    on your computer (Run->cmd on the pc and Terminal on the Mac). Change
                    to a directory where you have a css file you have written and follow
                    the directions in CSS Mastery to run the <kbd>stylelint</kbd> utility on the file.
                    How many errors did you have? Try outputting the errors to a file
                    using this syntax:
                  </p>
                  <pre><code class="lang-bash">stylelint stylesheet.css > csslintoutput.txt</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    Practice interpreting the error messages by fixing them until the test
                    comes back clean.
                  </p>
                  <div class="callout">
                    <p>
                      Linters have become quite popular not just with CSS, but also HTML
                      and Javascript. One thing to understand however is that they are
                      <strong>not</strong> validators. They will find some errors, but
                      they are more concerned with helping you write clean optimized,
                      readable code. They tend to be very opinionated as a result. They
                      don't just encourage you to write valid code, but
                      <em>correct</em> code by avoiding bad practices...according to
                      whomever setup the rules of the Linter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You may or may not agree with all these opinions however, and so
                      most Linting packages are configurable...you can use your own
                      opinions instead of someone else's. Instructions on how to modify
                      CSSLints defaults can be found at
                      <a href="https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/" target="_blank">stylelint user guide</a>.

                <h3>Analyze-css</h3>
                <p>
                   The next tool we will
                    use is Analyze-Css. With the same CSS file as the last step run the
                    analyze-css utility according to the instructions in CSS Master Ch3.
                  </p>
                  <div class="callout">
                    <p>
                      Try running each of these utilities without any arguments...just
                      type the command. You should see some hints on how to use the
                      command. This is pretty typical for these type of utilities and
                      learning how to read this type of concise help is a good skill to
                      develop.

                    <p>
                      if you run it for analyze-css for example you will see something
                      like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-bash">
analyze-css --url &lt;url&gt; [options]

Options:
--url                Set URL of CSS to analyze                                            
--file               Set local CSS file to analyze

                    <p>
                      There are certain conventions that are almost always followed with
                      these helps. Here are a few of the more common conventions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Things written in ALLCAPS or in <strong>bold</strong> often means
                        type it <em>exactly</em> as it appears,
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        and lowercase, <em>italics</em>, or surrounded with &lt; &gt; can
                        mean you are supposed to change it to something specific.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Something surrounded in [ ] is going to be an optional part of the
                        command. It will work with our without that part.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        A | (pipe) between two parameters means that you can use one or
                        the other, but not both.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The instructions from the book say to type something like this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="lang-bash">analyze-css --file filename.css</code></pre>
                    <p>
                      The results are not very readable however. How would you modify the
                      command to give better output?
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    Most of what Analyze-css gives back is informational. It tells you how
                    many selectors you are using, how specific they are (less specific is
                    usually better), if you are using any prefixed css that you don't need
                    to anymore, and then it will point out offenders and
                    duplicates...selectors that you really should look at and optimize.
                  </p>
                <!-- End Step-->
            </li>
            <li>
                <!-- start step-->
                <h3>Uncss</h3>
                <p>
                   Finally run the uncss
                    utility on your file. It is a great optimization tool. It looks at
                    your css and finds any rules that were not used...then removes them!
                    Try this for example. Take a look at the CSS for the
                    <a href="../resources/foundation.css" target="_blank"
                      >Foundation css framework</a
                    >. Then take a look at this simple
                    <a href="../resources/foundation-all.html" target="_blank"
                      >example page</a
                    >
                    that has the Foundation css linked in. Now run Uncss on it.
                  </p>
                  <pre><code class="lang-bash">
uncss http://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/foundation-all.html
                             </code></pre>
                  You may even want to send the results to a file like this:
                  <pre><code class="lang-bash">
uncss http://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/foundation-all.html > optimized.css
                             </code></pre>
                  <p>What was the result?</p>
                  <p>
                    <span class="highlight">Step 04:</span>&nbsp; Submit your output file
                    of errors from CSSLint in step 1, and the optimzed css file you got
                    from step 3 to ILearn.
                  </p>
                <!-- End Step-->
            </li>
