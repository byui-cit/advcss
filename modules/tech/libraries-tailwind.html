              >Build a Website with Tailwind CSS | Project Tutorial</a
            >
            tutorial on Youtube. The video uses some tools that require NodeJS.
            You should have
            <a href="../../lesson01/l01-software.html">installed</a> that at the
            beginning of the course.
          </p>

          <p>Watch for these things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you still have the Tailwind installation we did earlier, you
              can actually just use that for this tutorial...it is basically the
              same. The video does structure the files slightly differently, but
              the rest is the same.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Tailwind documentation can be found at
              <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation"></a>
              <kbd>tailwindcss.com</kbd>.
            </li>

            <li>
              Download the
              <a
                href="https://github.com/gitdagray/tailwind-css-course/tree/main/lesson02"
                >files for the tutorial</a
              >. You will need to do this to get the images used. Copy the
              images to the <code>build/img</code> folder if you are follwoing
              exactly along with the video or in the <code>public</code> folder
              if you are using the install we did earlier in the Unit.
