              >Build a Website with Tailwind CSS | Project Tutorial</a
            >
            tutorial on Youtube. The video uses some tools that require NodeJS.
            You should have
            <a href="../../lesson01/l01-software.html">installed</a> that at the
            beginning of the course.
          </p>

          <p>Watch for these things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you still have the Tailwind installation we did earlier, you
              can actually just use that for this tutorial...it is basically the
              same. The video does structure the files slightly differently, but
              the rest is the same.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have not yet done so...install the "Tailwind CSS
              Intellisense" extention in VSCode.
            </li>
            <li>
              The video makes good use of Emmet to autocomplete your html with
              classes. One disadvantage of that however is that you lose the
              benefit of the Intellisense. I would recommend not doing what the
              video recommends ie:
              <code
                >h2.text-4xl.font-bold.text-center.sm:text-5xl.mb-6.text-slate-900.dark:text-white</code
              >
              and then hitting 'tab', but instead: <code>h2.</code> 'tab'. That
              will expand into <code>&lt;h2 class=""&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</code> and
              then you can type in all of the classes with the benefit of the
              Intellisense.
            </li>
            <li>
              Speeding up the video in this case will probably not save you any
              time. You will be adding many many classes and will find yourself
              pausing a lot if you speed up the video to catch up. You might
              even consider slowing it down a smidge for this one.
            </li>

              The Tailwind documentation can be found at
              <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation"
                >tailwindcss.com</a
              >.
            </li>

            <li>
              Download the
              <a
                href="https://github.com/gitdagray/tailwind-css-course/tree/main/lesson02"
                >files for the tutorial</a
              >. You will need to do this to get the images used. Copy the
              <code>img</code> folder to the <code>build</code> folder if you
              are following exactly along with the video or in the
              <code>public</code> folder if you are using the install we did
              earlier in the Unit.
