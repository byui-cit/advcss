        <h2>Style Stage</h2>
        <p>
          Open up the following link to a
          <a href="https://github.com/5t3ph/stylestage-sass">Github repo</a>.
          This is a starter for the
          <a href="https://stylestage.dev">Style Stage</a> site. We will be
          building our own version of this site as a team project this
          semester...more about this next week ;)
        </p>
        <h2>SCSS syntax cont.</h2>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <h3>Sass partials</h3>
            <p>
              Open the link above to the Style Stage starter repo. Browse into
              the <kbd>sass</kbd> directory and review the list of files. Note
              all of the files that begin with <code>_</code>. These are special
              Sass files called partials or modules. The leading underscore is
              important. These files are never intended to be used on their own.
              Instead they would always be used by being included in a larger
              SCSS file. The underscore is a message to the Sass compiler to
              ignore those files until they are used.
            </p>
            <p>
              It would never make sense for example to have an
              <kbd>about.css</kbd> file. So we don't want the compiler to ever
              generate one. The leading underscore accomplishes that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Open the <kbd>style.scss</kbd> file. Notice that is is the only
              file that does not have an underscore in it's name. This is the
              file that we want to be compiled and that we would eventually
              expect to see a <code>.css</code> version of.
            </p>
            <p>Note the contents of that file:</p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">@import "fonts";
// You can modify the theme directly, or override some of the variables
// Overrides just need placed prior to the theme import
// For example:
// $color-primary: #3a0;
@import "theme";
@import "reset";
@import "logomark";
@import "typography";
@import "layout";
@import "header";
@import "nav";
@import "about";
@import "guidelines";
@import "contribute";
@import "files";
@import "styles";
@import "profile";
@import "footer";
@import "links";</code></pre>
            <p>
              Here we see an example of how to use a partial. This shows the
              <code>@import</code> syntax, note however that the
              <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import"
                >Sass site is phasing out @import</a
              >
              and instead recommends that you use the
              <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use"
                >@use</a
              >
              command instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              The important thing to note is that if we add another partial
              file, we should also add another @import or @use line to this
              file!
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
              If you open up the <kbd>public/style.css</kbd> file in that repo
              you can see what this file will compile to. That can often help to
              understand what is going on!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Variables cont.</h3>
            <p>
              If you open up the <kbd>_theme.scss</kbd> file next you will see
              some excellent examples of using not only Sass variables, but also
              using them together with CSS custom properties.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the top of the file you will see the defining of several
              variables
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">
$color-primary: #3a00ff !default;
$color-primary-alt: #6f6ffd !default;
$color-secondary: #d42257 !default;
$color-background: #d2fbf7 !default;
        </code></pre>
            <p class="callout">
              You may have noticed the <code>!default</code> keyword. To find
              out what it does check out the
              <a
                href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables#default-values"
                >documentation</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>After that we see something new.</p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">$brand-colors: (
    primary: $color-primary,
    primary-alt: $color-primary-alt,
    secondary: $color-secondary,
) !default;</code></pre>
            <p>
              If you are familiar with lists, Maps, or arrays from other
              programming languages...this is how you do the same in Sass. If
              you scroll down to around line 55 of that file you can see an
              example of using that list.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">
:root {
    @each $key, $color in $colors {
        --color-#{$key}: #{$color};
    }
    
    --color-anchor: #{$link-color};
    --font-family: "Baloo 2", sans-serif;
    --font-weight-strong: #{$font-weight-strong};
    
    @each $key, $size in $font-sizes {
        --font-size-#{$key}: #{$size};
    }
    
    --border-radius: #{$border-radius};
}
</code></pre>
            <p>
              Here we can see an example of a Sass loop to generate some custom
              properties. If we were to compile that it would look like this:
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
              Did you notice the <code>#{}</code> around many of the sass
              variables? This is an example of
              <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/interpolation"
                >interpolation</a
              >
              in Sass.

            <h3>Mixin example</h3>
            <p>
              Next open the <kbd>_logomark.scss</kbd> file. It's a mixin! Take a
              moment and look over it. What does it do?
            </p>
            <p>
              Next open the <kbd>_header.scss</kbd>, and
              <kbd>_footer.scss</kbd> files. Notice a couple of things. First
              there are some custom properties being defined in each of those
              files: <code>--logomark-height</code>, and
              <code>--logomark-padding</code>. Notice also that the values are
              different in both the header and footer! Notice as well that our
              mixin makes use of those custom properties.
            </p>

            <h3>The reset</h3>
            <p>
              Finally open up the <kbd>_reset.scss</kbd> file. A reset is a CSS
              file that is designed to remove some or all of the default browser
              styling. In this case it is a light reset. Review the changes, pay
              special attention to the last thing in there:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="lang-css">
/* Remove all animations and transitions for people that prefer not to see them */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }
}</code> </pre>

            <!-- Step End -->
          </li>

            <!-- Step Start -->

              We will be looking more closely at the Style Stage project next
              week. Feel free to poke through the rest of the files this week to
              familiarize yourself with them.
