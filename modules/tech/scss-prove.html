        <h1>Converting CSS to SCSS</h1>

        <hr />

        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p class="callout">
          During the first week of the semester you were asked to produce the
          css for a website. This week we will take that css and convert it to
          scss.
        </p>
        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>Demonstrate SCSS skills using variables, mixins, and nesting by modifying your css from Week 1 into SCSS. 
        </p>

            <li>
              <!-- Step Start -->
              <h3>Rename your CSS file</h3>
              <p>
                Rename your css file from the review website from
                <strong>.css</strong> to <strong>.scss</strong>. Review the css you
                produced to see where SCSS might be helpful.

                <h3>Convert CSS -> SCSS</h3>
                <p>
                    Add variables, nesting,
                    and mixins where appropriate. You must however use each of those at
                    least once.

                    <p>
                      If you are worried about having enough css to convert to scss let me
                      give you a couple of ideas.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        A great place to use nesting is with pseudo-classes like
                        <kbd>:hover</kbd> or <kbd>:active</kbd>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        @media queries are another great place to take advantage of
                        nesting.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Any colors or widths you have in your css would be good candidates
                        for variables.
                      </li>
                      
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                <!-- Step End -->
              </li>
                
        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Sass variables used correctly where appropriate.</li>
          <li>At least one example of nesting is used.</li>
          <li>At least one mixin is created and used correctly.</li>
        </ul>
