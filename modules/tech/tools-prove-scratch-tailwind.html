        <h1>Front end Development Workflow with Tailwind.</h1>

        <hr />
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank">TailwindCss</a>
            advertises itself as "A utility-first CSS framework...". It has
            rapidly grown in popularity among web developers and is worth taking
            a look at.
          </p>
          <p>
            A framework is really just a collection of code (in this case html,
            css, and javascript) and design patterns that solve common design
            problems. Utility classes have always existed in CSS. they are
            simpole classes that do one thing and one thing only. A team will
            create them on a project by project basis as needed. Tailwind takes
            utilities to the extreme. Essentially <em>everything</em> is a small
            focused utility class in TailwindCss.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tailwind has been a bit polarizing. It does definately bloat up your
            HTML with lots and lots of classes. It's proponents however say that
            it is worth it for the speed at which they can style pages and
            components once they learn it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
        <p>
          There are several utilities you will need to make sure are working on
          your computer for the install to go smoothly. If you followed the
          <a href="../lesson01/l01-software.html" target="_blank"
            >software setup instructions</a
          >
          you should be most of the way there. Here is a list of things to
          verify. Open a command line window and try the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure that Node is installed and that you have the correct
            version by entering:
            <pre><code class="bash">node -v</code></pre>
            You should see a version number. That version should start with
            14.x.x or 16.x.x. If you get any errors or "command not found" try
            running through the
            <a href="../lesson01/l01-software.html" target="_blank"
              >software setup instructions</a
            >
            again.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have not spent much time in the command line of your
            operating system you should review
            <a
              href="https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/modules/general/cli-basics/"
              >CLI Basics</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you run into any issues get some help from a fellow student or the
          instructor.
        </p>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>
          Tailwind is actually built or compiled similar to SCSS. Because of
          this you need to install the tailwind application in order to use it.
          This activity will show one way of setting up a new project that uses
          Tailwind.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>
          Create a folder on your computer called <kbd>tailwind-demo</kbd>. Open
          that <strong>folder</strong> in your editor (this activity will be
          easier if you are using VS Code as your editor). If you are not using
          VS Code I would recommend creating this folder on your Desktop so it
          will be easier to find.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are using VS Code as your editor you can open the terminal in
          your open project (ctrl + ~) and it will automatically set the working
          directory to the open project folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are using some other editor, Open your command line prompt on
          your computer and navigate to the directory containing your created
          directory.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Mac and Windows should start you in your user directory when you
            open a new command prompt. Or you can type:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Mac:
              <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd ~</code></pre>
              (tilde) or
            </li>
            <li>
              Windows:
              <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd %userprofile%</code></pre>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            from anywhere and it will take you back to your user directory. From
            the User directory you should just need to type
          </p>
          <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd Desktop</code></pre>
          then
          <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd tailwind-demo</code></pre>
          <p>to get to the right place.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Once you are in the right directory type:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm init -y</code></pre>
        <p>
          This will create a file called <kbd>package.json</kbd>. This file will
          contain the details about our project.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Modern web projects rely on a few types of tools to make them easier
            to manage.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Package Managers</dt>
            <dd>
              This tool controls all of the dependencies for the project...it
              lets us easliy include tools written by others to both help us in
              development, and to include additional functionality in our
              finished product. It really helps when it's time to update to a
              newer version of one of these tools.
            </dd>
            <dt>Asset Bundlers</dt>
            <dd>
              These gather all of the assets that our project needs and
              consolidates and processes them. A web app for example might have
              dozens of javascript files containing it's code. The bundler will
              combine them all together and minimize them...and then move the
              final file into a folder ready for distribution.
            </dd>
            <dt>Task Manager</dt>
            <dd>
              There are many processes that need to be run each time a change is
              made to the project. Sass needs to compiled and possibly
              autoprefixed and minimized, javascript combined and maybe
              transpiled, etc. A task manager can be configured to allow all of
              these tasks to be automated.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <br />
          <p>
            For this project <code>NPM</code> is our package manager. In fact
            when you ran <code>npm init</code> we did the first step in making
            this happen. Another popular package manage is
            <a href="https://pnpm.io">PNPM</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            We are using a tool called Vite for bundling. Other popular bundlers
            would be <code>webpack</code> or <code>Parcel</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally since our project is fairly simple we are actually using NPM
            as our task manager as well. If you look again in the
            <code>package.json</code> file you will see a section called
            <code>scripts</code>. We will place commands there to do different
            things for our project. Other popular task managers are Grunt and
            Gulp
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>
          Install Vite by typing
          <code>npm install -D vite</code> (make sure that you are in the same
          directory that the <kbd>package.json</kbd> file is in) in the command
          line. This will add Vite as a development dependancy to our
          project...a tool that we will use as developers to do our work. You
          should notice that a couple of things changed: first a new folder
          called <kbd>node_modules</kbd> was created, second a new section
          called <code>devDependencies</code> was added to our
          <kbd>package.json.</kbd>
        </p>
        <p>
          Next we need to add some scripts to allow us to use Vite. Add the
          following code to the <kbd>scripts</kbd> section of your
          <kbd>package.json</kbd>
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-js">
"scripts": {
    "start": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
},
        </code></pre>
        <!-- <p class="callout">
          While you are in the <kbd>package.json</kbd> file we have just a bit
          of cleanup to do. There is a line that looks like this:
          <code>main: 'index.js',</code> We need to remove that line or when we
          try to run our build command it might fail.
        </p> -->
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>
          https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss Vite is a very
          flexible tool that will accomodate a wide range of file structure in
          our projects. We will keep ours simple however. Once we have
          everything setup with Vite and Tailwind our file structure should look
          something like below.
        </p>
        <pre>
project-name/
├── dist/
├── node_modules/
├── css/
│   └── style.css
├── public
├── index.html
├── postcss.config.js
├── tailwind.config.js  
└── package.json</pre
        >
        <p>
          The <kbd>dist</kbd> directory will get created automatically for us
          later, as well as the <kbd>postcss.config.js</kbd> and
          <kbd>tailwind.config.css</kbd>, but we should create the other folders
          and files now.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a <kbd>css</kbd> directory in the root of the project folder,
            then add a <kbd>style.css</kbd> file inside of that directory.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a <kbd>public</kbd> directory in the root of the project
            folder that will contain images and other static assets
          </li>

          <li>
            Create an <kbd>index.html</kbd> file and add the following code:
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" &gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1 class="text-3xl text-red-500 underline"&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h1&gt;
  
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
            </code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Test our installation by running the following</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm run start</code></pre>
        <p>
          in the command line of your computer. Make sure you are still in the
          project folder. (the same folder that contains the
          <kbd>package.json</kbd> file) This will start up a simple web server
          pointed at our project. It will also watch for changes to either the
          .CSS files or the .JS files and it will recompile them when needed and
          refresh the page in the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see your site notice that Vite output
          <kbd> ➜ Local: http://localhost:5175/</kbd> when it started up. Your
          port number (ie :5175) will probably be different. Enter that url in
          your browser to see it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are ready to stop the web server type <code>ctrl+c</code> in
          the command line.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>
          Next let's install Tailwind using our package manager. Go back to your
          command prompt and quit the webserver if it is running (ctrl+c). Then
          type
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer</code></pre>
        <p>After that has finished run one more command:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">npx tailwindcss init -p</code></pre>
        <p>This will create the two missing config files for us.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            You may be asking yourselves: "I thought we just needed Tailwind?
            Why postcss and autoprefixer?" Postcss is a very handy plugin
            manager that will allow us to do all sorts of things to our CSS. We
            will use it to compile our Tailwind code to CSS and then to
            automatically apply any prefixes that we might need as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            We could also apply plugins that would allow us to use nesting
            without SCSS, or use SCSS style import statements.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The add command retrieved the packages and placed them into the
          <code>node_modules</code> directory, but our project still doesn't
          know about them. Lets do that next.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>
          Finish installing Tailwind into your project by opening the
          <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file in an editor and changing the
          line with the <code>content</code>
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
            content: ["./*.{html,js}"],
            </code> </pre>
        <p>
          Those lines will make it possible for Tailwind to know which files to
          look at when it is building the final CSS file. We basically tell it
          to "start in the current directory (./), then look for any files (*)
          that have a .js or .html extention (.{html,js})".
        </p>
        <p>
          One last step. Open up the <code>style.css</code> file and add the
          following lines:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-css">
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          Ok, lets try firing up our development server again. Type
          <code>npm run start</code>. Your page should have picked up a bit more
          styling...red, a different font. If you see that then it's working! If
          not then review the directions above, or ask for help.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            You may have noticed that we are still missing one folder that was
            mentioned above: <code>dist</code>. To get that folder we can run
            another command. First focus the terminal window (click in it), then
            press ctrl-c to make sure that Vite is not still running. Then type
            <code>npm run build</code>. That command tells Vite to build a
            production ready version of our code and it will place it in a
            directory called <code>dist</code>. If we were going to make this
            site live on a server that is the code we would move.
          </p>
          <p>
            Open that directory and check out the files that were generated:
            <code>dist/assets/index.?????.css</code>. Why does it have a bunch
            of random characters in the name? Well good webservers in order to
            be efficient will cache things like CSS and Javascript files. So
            sometimes when you make updates you will see the old version of the
            file for a bit until the cache finally updates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding the random characters on the build file is sometimes called
            cache busting. It is a new file and so will show up the first time
            you request it!
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>
          So how do you actually use Tailwind CSS now that we have it setup? As
          you are learning it be prepared to be in the documentation a lot. (<a
            href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation"
            >Tailwindcss</a
          >). Use the search by the way...it's very useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we wanted to start making a header for a site, with a logo and list
          of links we might write the HTML and CSS something like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;header&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;My Site&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 1&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 2&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 3&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <pre><code class="lang-css">
header {
  max-width: 1024px;
  background-color: lightyellow;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  margin: 0 auto;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1em;
}
header > h1 {
  font-size: 3em;
  margin: 0;
}
nav > a {
  margin-right: 1em;
  font-size: 1.2em;
}
nav > a:hover {
  color: #888;
}         
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          In Tailwind the CSS has pretty much already been written and instead
          we would apply classes to the HTML to accomplish our styling. For
          example to set a max-width, center, and background color on the header
          we would do the following:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;header class="max-w-5xl mx-auto bg-yellow-200"&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;My Site&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 1&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 2&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href="#"&gt;Link 3&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;
                  </code></pre>

        <p>To continue with the Flexbox we add more classes:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;header class="max-w-5xl mx-auto bg-yellow-200 flex justify-between items-center p-4"&gt;

          We would continue adding classes until it was all styled...and would
          write NO CSS. How do you know what classes to add you may be asking?
          At first you will be spending a lot of time in the documentation
          looking things up. But as you become familiar with the conventions
          Tailwind uses you will be able to guess more and more effectively. One
          thing that will help immensely with this is to install the Tailwind
          CSS Intellisense extention.

          Let's work through a larger example. To get started we are going to
          recreate a section of the
          <a href="https://www.nationalparks.org">National Parks Foundation</a>
          website. To save us some time the HTML we will be using will be
          provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          Open the following link
          <a href="../examples/nat-parks/index-start.html">starting html</a> in
          a new tab and copy/paste the <code>body</code> into the index file we
          have been working with in this activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Follow the comments in the HTML and use Tailwind classes to style it.
          When we are done ours will not look exactly like the example. That
          site is using a customized Tailwind, but we should be able to get it
          close. See below for a few tips:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using the default serif and sans-serif fonts in the Tailwind theme
            will get us close enough.
          </li>
          <li>
            At one point we will need to set some padding to a vw height.
            Tailwind does not come with that option so we will have to extend
            it. Open up the <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file and find the
            section that looks like this:
            <pre><code class="lang-js">theme: {
  extend: {
    
  }</code></pre>
            Make it look like this:
            <pre><code class="lang-js">theme: {
  extend: {
    spacing: {
      "resp-8": "8vw",
      "resp-24": "24vw"
    }
  }</code></pre>
            You can use these custom spacings like this:
            <code>pb-resp-8</code> (padding bottom: resp-8)
          </li>
          <li>
            Install the VSCode Tailwind CSS Intellisense extension. It is very
            helpful.
          </li>
