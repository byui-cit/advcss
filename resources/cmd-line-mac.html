        <h1>Using the command line on a Mac</h1>

        <hr />
        <p>
          the command line on a Mac can be found by running the Terminal App in
          /Applications/Utilities. Terminal allows us to run special commands on
          the computer that cannot be found in the graphical user interface.
          These commands are usually short words that may be followed by one or
          more parameters...bits of other information that the command needs to
          run. Commands in the Terminal always run in the current directory. One
          of the most important tasks you can learn with the command line is
          changing working directories.
        </p>

        <p>
          To change directories on a mac we first need to know where we
          currently are. Type:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">pwd</code></pre>
        <p>
          in the Terminal app. You will probably see something like this:
          <kbd>/Users/username</kbd>. If you didn't see something similar to
          that then type:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd ~</code></pre>
        <p>
          'cd' is the command (change directory), '~' (tilde) is a parameter
          that means 'location of my home directory'. That command then will
          take you to your home directory. If I wanted to see what folders and
          files were in my current directory I could type:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">ls</code></pre>
        <p>Try that now.</p>
        <p>
          Lets assume that the directory I need to get to is at
          <kbd>Documents/school-stuff/project1</kbd>. when you did the list
          command earlier you probably saw that the Documents folder is inside
          the directory we are currently in. In fact the full path to the
          directory I want is
          <kbd>/Users/username/Documents/school-stuff/project1</kbd>
        </p>
        <p>
          To change directories in the Terminal we use the '<kbd>cd</kbd>'
          (change directory) command. If I want to enter the Documents directory
          (and I see it when I type '<kbd>ls</kbd>') I simply type:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd Documents</code></pre>
        <p>If I want to go back to where I was I can type:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd ..</code></pre>
        <p>('..' is a shortcut for parent directory)</p>
        <p>I can also change multiple directories at once. like so:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd Documents/school-stuff/project1</code></pre>
        <p>
          One trick that can help you as you are navigating with the Terminal is
          the 'tab' key. 'tab' autocompletes what you are typing if it can. So
          if I started typing
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd Doc</code></pre>
        <p>then hit 'tab' it would autocomplete to:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd Documents</code></pre>
        <p>Then I could keep typing:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd Documents/scho</code></pre>
        <p>hit 'tab' again and it should autocomplete to:</p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd Documents/school-stuff</code></pre>
        <p>
          If you hit 'tab' and nothing happens then it means the computer either
          can't find a match or there is more than one match. The command line
          is also case sensitive...meaning 'doc' is different than 'Doc'.
          Remember that 'ls' is your friend. It will always show you the
          contents of whatever directory you are in.
        </p>
        <p>
          One last tip. Apple has actually put a bit of work on making the
          Terminal aware of what is going on in the Finder. Another way you can
          get to a specific folder in Terminal would be to type
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd </code></pre>
        <p>
          then drag the folder you want from the Finder window onto the Terminal
          window. In the case of this example if you have done correctly it
          should show something like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-bash">cd /Users/username/Documents/school-stuff/project1</code></pre>
        <p>
          The advantage of this is that it doesn't matter what directory you
          started in...it will always take you to the directory specified.
        </p>

          need more help.
