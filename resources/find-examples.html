        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          The web is a rapidly evolving platform. CSS changes regularly and the
          ways that it is used in building web sites change as well. Over the
          first few weeks of the semester you need to pay close attention to
          every website you visit. Take note of anything that catches your
          attention. You are looking for things that the builder of the site has
          done that you think are cool and that you would be interested in
          learning how to replicate. Essentially anything that causes you to
          think "I wonder how they did that?" should get recorded.
        </p>

        <p>
          In week 4 you will be asked to turn in 3-4 of your examples. Try to
          find different types of examples, ie:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Layouts that you think are unique or clever</li>
          <li>A reusable component (a part of a page)</li>
          <li>Animations</li>
          <li>A creative take on a form or form input.</li>
          <li>etc...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Submit the link to your example and then what you found interesting.
          Be specific! After all of the examples are submitted we will discuss
          them as a class and decide which ones we want to try and learn how to
          duplicate. We will spend anywhere from a few days to up to three weeks
          on each example that we choose. We will work through weeks 5-12 of the
          course completing as many as we can.

          Do they submit to ilearn and Trello? If all the students were added to
          a shared board, and they added their ideas to it with screenshots...it
          would be really easy to review...but it would be hard to grade...
