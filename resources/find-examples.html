        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          The web is a rapidly evolving platform. CSS changes regularly and the
          ways that it is used in building web sites change as well. Over the
          first few weeks of the semester you need to pay close attention to
          every website you visit. Take note of anything that catches your
          attention. You are looking for things that the builder of the site has
          done that you think are cool and that you would be interested in
          learning how to replicate. Essentially anything that causes you to
          think "I wonder how they did that?" should get recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you find good examples please post your favorites to the
          <a href="#">class Trello board</a>. Include a screenshot, the link,
          and a description of what you were interested in. Be specific in the
          descriptions in the Trello cards!
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of week 3 you should have contributed 2-3 examples to
          Trello. At that time submit the links to your examples here in ILearn
          as well. Try to find different types of examples, ie:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Layouts that you think are unique or clever</li>
          <li>A reusable component (a part of a page)</li>
          <li>Animations</li>
          <li>A creative take on a form or form input.</li>
          <li>etc...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In week 4, after all of the examples are submitted, the list will be
          curated and we will decide which ones we want to try and learn how to
          duplicate. We will spend anywhere from a few days to up to three weeks
          on each example that we choose. We will work through weeks 5-12 of the
          course completing as many as we can.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we begin working on the examples it is important to remember a few
          things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The purpose of these exercises is to <strong>learn</strong>. Do not
            let concerns about doing it wrong or right get in the way of your
            learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your instructor should provide initial help in deconstructing the
            problem and identifying topics you may need to study in order to be
            successful. Some resources will be provided, others you will be
            expected to find on your own. When you find a good helpful resource
            <strong>please share it with your classmates!</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Be prepared to <span class="strike">fail</span>
            <em>have our goals and expectations change</em>. We may not succeed
            in replicating each example we attempt. This is ok as long as we
            learn something from each attempt.
          </li>
        </ul>
