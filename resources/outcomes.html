            <h2>Grading</h2>
            <p>Formative assessments will <strong>not</strong> be graded in this course though students are encouraged to request feedback on their work often.  Twice during the semester (midterm and end of semester) the student should schedule a meeting with the instructor to discuss and evaluate how they are progressing on each objective. <strong>If the student fails to schedule and attend these two meetings they will be given an F</strong>.</p>
            <p>The objectives will be evaluated according to the following scale:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Distinguished (4)</dt>
                <dd>represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems.</dd>
                <dt>Proficient (3)</dt>
                <dd>represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and incorporation of the material which would prepare a student to be successful in next level courses, graduate school or employment. </dd>
                <dt>Developing (2)</dt>
                <dd>represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced courses could be attempted, but mastering new materials might prove challenging.</dd>
                <dt>Unsatisfactory (1)</dt>
                <dd>represents poor performance and initiative to learn and understand and apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be necessary to prepare for additional instruction in this subject matter. </dd>
            </dl>
            <hr />
            <p>At the end of the semester the final evaluation scores for each objective will be averaged and a grade assigned according to the following grade scale.</p>
                <h3>Grade Scale</h3>
                <ul >
                    <li>A: 3.5 - 4</li>
