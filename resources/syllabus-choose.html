        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
          This course provides deeper learning into topics in cascading style
          sheets (CSS). Topics of study will include: complex CSS selectors,
          advanced CSS layout and positioning techniques, CSS transitions and
          animations, CSS Preprocessing, an introduction to CSS libraries, and
          using scalable vector graphics (SVG) with HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
        <p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Solve problems through independent study and application—learn how
            to learn.
          </li>
          <li>Demonstrate a mastery of CSS.</li>
          <li>
            Understand the role of CSS preprocessors and how to effectively
            integrate their use in development workflows.
          </li>

          <li>
            Work effectively within a team by teaching and learning
            collaboratively, communicating clearly, fulfilling assignments and
            meeting deadlines.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Notice Outcome One...learn how to learn. It's placement at the
          beginning of the list is intentional. CSS and how it is applied in the
          creation of websites is still evolving and changing. The most
          important thing you can take from this class is the improved ability
          to learn new things so that you can stay current as technologies
          change. The structure of the course reflects the importance of outcome
          one.
        </p>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

          <li>CSS Selectors</li>

        <p>
          You may be looking at weeks 5-12 and wondering why there are no topics
          set. Remember outcome one above? There are certain topics that are
          critical that you gain some knowledge of. We will study those in weeks
          1-4. After that the course will change and adapt to what the class
          decides they would like to study next. At the end of each week the
          class will come together and decide what will be studied the following
          week from a list of provided modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What if we miss an important module?" you may be asking yourself.
          Well, you probably will :) There is not enough time to learn
          everything we could on the topic of CSS. This format will allow us to
          prioritize what is important for you right NOW while helping you
          become better at picking up the rest of it later as needed.
        </p>

        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>
          Each week you will be expected to complete 1 point worth of modules.
          As you complete them you will be asked to complete a reflection
          assignment. Please take this seriously. This reflection will ask about
          what you learned that impacted you, what questions you still have on
          the topic, and what resources you found where you might be able to
          answer those questions. You will also use the reflection to ask for
          specific feedback from the instructor. These reflections will be worth
          30% of your final grade.
        </p>
        <h3>Module assignments</h3>
        <p>
          Each Module will have one or more activities in it. Note that in most
          cases you will not turn in the completed activity until the end of the
          semester. In order to get feedback from the instructor for your work
          you must ask for it! This can happen in two ways, reach out directly
          while you are working on it with questions, or by indicating in the
          weekly reflection. Please ask for feedback when you need it!
        </p>

        <h3>Final Project</h3>
        <p>
          There will be a final project that will be completed as a small group
          (2-3 members) over the course of the semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          The assignment will be to create a version of the
          <a href="http://csszengarden.com" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a>
          (http://csszengarden.com) Each group will be responsible to decide
          upon a theme, then design and build their version according to the
          rules of the Zen Garden.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students will self-select into groups of 2-3 during the first few
          weeks of the semester. You will want to try and find others who
          complement your strengths. Ideally you will be able to finish the
          project with the same group you started with, but this is not
          required. You must however participate in each portion and will be
          responsible to bring yourself up to speed quickly with the new group
          if you switch.
        </p>
        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
        <p>
          All of the work which you complete for the course should be gathered
          in a portfolio website. If you have your own host you can place it
          there, if not I would recommend using something like Github pages to
          host your portfolio. If you are not sure how to set Github pages up,
          <a
            href="https://byui-cit.github.io/cit261/resources/portfolio.html"
            target="_blank"
            >refer to this activity</a
          >
          for instructions and an example.
        </p>
        <h3>Self Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          At midterm and again at the end of the semester you will be asked to
          complete a self evaluation of how you are progressing toward the
          outcomes of the course. Your portfolio will be used by the instructor
          to validate your self evaluations and give feedback. This will account
          for the other 70% of your grade.
        </p>

        <p>The outcomes will be evaluated according to the following scale:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Distinguished (4)</dt>
          <dd>
            represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration
            of subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking,
            skillful use of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex
            problems.
          </dd>
          <dt>Proficient (3)</dt>
          <dd>
            represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and
            incorporation of the material which would prepare a student to be
            successful in next level courses, graduate school or employment.
          </dd>
          <dt>Developing (2)</dt>
          <dd>
            represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student
            demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced
            courses could be attempted, but mastering new materials might prove
            challenging.
          </dd>
          <dt>Unsatisfactory (1)</dt>
          <dd>
            represents poor performance and initiative to learn and understand
            and apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be
            necessary to prepare for additional instruction in this subject
            matter.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <hr />
        <p>
          At the end of the semester the final evaluation scores for each
          objective will be averaged and a grade assigned according to the
          following grade scale.
        </p>
        <h3>Grade Scale</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A: 3.5 - 4</li>
          <li>B: 2.5 - 3.4</li>
          <li>C: 1.5 - 2.4</li>
          <li>F: &lt; 1.5</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Overall Grading</h2>
        <p>
          The final percentage will be a combination of the self-evaluation
          score (70%) plus the weekly reflection score (30%). The following
          grade scale will determine your grade:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>A</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;93.00%-100%</li>
          <li><b>A-</b>&nbsp; 90.00%-92.99%</li>
          <li><b>B+&nbsp;</b>87.00%-89.99%</li>
          <li><b>B</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;83.00%-86.99%</li>
          <li><b>B-</b>&nbsp; 80.00%-82.99%</li>
          <li><b>C+</b> 77.00%-79.99%</li>
          <li><b>C</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;73.00%-76.99%</li>
          <li><b>C-</b>&nbsp; 70.00%-72.99%</li>
          <li><b>D</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;60.00%-69.99%</li>
          <li><b>F</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; below 60%</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Standards</h2>
        <p>
          Be responsible for your own education. Take responsibility to complete
          your homework as assigned. Be prepared to accept the consequences if
          you do not.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >It is important that you prepare yourself each week to contribute
            actively in learning with your fellow students. Be respectful of
            each other’s time and be prompt to any meetings that may be
            scheduled.</em
