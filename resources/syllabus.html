            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
            <p>Students should have completed either CIT 230 or Comm 310 before taking this course.</p>
            <h2>Software and Resources</h2>
            <p>We will be using materials from SitePoint.com (http://sitepoint.com). You will need access to their premier resources. The University has set up a special pricing for students of $10/semester. You will automatically be charged this fee after the add/drop date has passed for the semester. You can gain access by going here: <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium" target="_blank">https://www.sitepoint.com/premium</a> and clicking on the "Sign Up" button in the top right corner. <strong>You must register for this with your BYUI.EDU email address!</strong></p>
            <p>The text will be CSS Master by Tiffany Brown. Once you have subscribed you can read it online or download it as pdf or epub.</p>
            <p>We will also be using an online editing tool for HTML/CSS/Javascript called <a href="http://codepen.io" target="_blank">CodePen</a> (http://codepen.io). You will need to create a free account with them.</p>
            <p>You will also want a good text editor installed on your computer. If you don’t have one you like, a few I can recommend are below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://brackets.io" target="_blank">Brackets</a> (http://brackets.io): Free, Mac/Windows/Linux, specifically made for HTML/CSS editing.</li>
                <li><a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank">Atom</a> (https://atom.io): Free, Mac/Windows/Linux, good general purpose editor with great Git support.</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> (http://www.sublimetext.com) $70, Mac/Windows/Linux, good general purpose editor.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Assessments</h2>
            <p>There will be 1-2 homework assignments each week over the course of the semester. Details about those can be found in ILearn. Most are due at Saturday 11pm of the week in which they are given.</p>
            <p> All homework assignments will receive equal weight and collectively will constitute 60% of your final grade for the course. </p>
            <p>Late homework assignments will be accepted for a maximum of 50% credit.</p>
            <h2>Final Project</h2>
            <p>There will be a final project that will be completed as a small group (2-3 members) over the course of the semester. This project will constitute 30% of your final grade for the course. </p>
            <p>The assignment will be to create a version of the <a href="http://csszengarden.com" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a> (http://csszengarden.com) Each group will be responsible to decide upon a theme, then design and build their version according to the rules of the Zen Garden.</p>
            <p>Students will self-select into groups of 2-3 during the first few weeks of the semester. You will want to try and find others who complement your strengths. Ideally you will be able to finish the project with the same group you started with, but this is not required. You must however participate in each portion and will be responsible to bring yourself up to speed quickly with the new group if you switch.
            </p>
            <h2>Overall Grading</h2>
            <p>The final percentage will determine your grade as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>A</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;93.00%-100%</li>
                <li><b>A-</b>&nbsp; 90.00%-92.99%</li>
                <li><b>B+&nbsp;</b>87.00%-89.99%</li>
                <li><b>B</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;83.00%-86.99%</li>
                <li><b>B-</b>&nbsp; 80.00%-82.99%</li>
                <li><b>C+</b> 77.00%-79.99%</li>

                <li><b>F</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; below 60%</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Standards</h2>
                <p>Be responsible for your own education.  Take responsibility to complete your homework as assigned.  Be prepared to accept the consequences if you do not.</p>
            <p><em>It is important that you prepare yourself each week to contribute actively in learning with your fellow students. Be respectful of each other’s time and be prompt to any meetings that may be scheduled.</em>
</p>
       <h2>Student Sexual Harassment Statement</h2>
       <p>Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in an educational program or activity that receives federal funds, including Federal loans and grants.  Title IX also covers student-to-student sexual harassment.  If you encounter unlawful sexual harassment or gender-based discrimination, please contact the Personnel Office at 496-1130.</p>
       <h2>Student Disability Statement</h2>
