        <h2>Assessments</h2>
        <p>
          There will be 1-2 homework assignments each week over the course of
          the semester. Details about those can be found in ILearn. Most are due
          Saturday at midnight of the week in which they are given.
        </p>
        <p>
          All homework assignments will receive equal weight and collectively
          will constitute 60% of your final grade for the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Late homework assignments will be accepted for a maximum of 50%
          credit.
        </p>
        <h2>Final Project</h2>
        <p>
          There will be a final project that will be completed as a small group
          (2-3 members) over the course of the semester. This project will
          constitute 30% of your final grade for the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          The assignment will be to create a version of the
          <a href="http://csszengarden.com" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a>
          (http://csszengarden.com) Each group will be responsible to decide
          upon a theme, then design and build their version according to the
          rules of the Zen Garden.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students will self-select into groups of 2-3 during the first few
          weeks of the semester. You will want to try and find others who
          complement your strengths. Ideally you will be able to finish the
          project with the same group you started with, but this is not
          required. You must however participate in each portion and will be
          responsible to bring yourself up to speed quickly with the new group
          if you switch.
        </p>
        <h2>Overall Grading</h2>
        <p>The final percentage will determine your grade as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>A</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;93.00%-100%</li>
          <li><b>A-</b>&nbsp; 90.00%-92.99%</li>
          <li><b>B+&nbsp;</b>87.00%-89.99%</li>
          <li><b>B</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;83.00%-86.99%</li>
          <li><b>B-</b>&nbsp; 80.00%-82.99%</li>
          <li><b>C+</b> 77.00%-79.99%</li>
          <li><b>C</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;73.00%-76.99%</li>
          <li><b>C-</b>&nbsp; 70.00%-72.99%</li>
          <li><b>D+</b> 67.00%-69.99%</li>
          <li><b>D</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;63.00%-66.99%</li>
          <li><b>D-</b>&nbsp; 60.00%-62.99%</li>
          <li><b>F</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; below 60%</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Standards</h2>
        <p>
          Be responsible for your own education. Take responsibility to complete
          your homework as assigned. Be prepared to accept the consequences if
          you do not.
        </p>

            >It is important that you prepare yourself each week to contribute
            actively in learning with your fellow students. Be respectful of
