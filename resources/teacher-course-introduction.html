        <hr />

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This course is designed in a way that tries to recognize that most of
          the specific technologies we could study related to CSS will change.
          The placement of the first outcome is not random.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          1. Solve problems through independent study and applicationâ€”learn how
          to learn.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          It is the most important thing the students could gain from this
          course.
        </p>
        <p>
          This course is also repeatable. The course design is also to
          accommodate that. The first four weeks are set, they will always be
          the same thing:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Review and introduction</li>
          <li>Selectors</li>
          <li>SCSS</li>
          <li>Zen Garden introduction</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Also during those first four weeks the students will be asked to pay
          close attention to every website they visit. They should take note of
          anything that catches their attention. They are looking for things
          that the builder of the site has done that they think are cool and
          that they would be interested in learning how to replicate. The ideas
          can be submitted at anytime during the first 4 weeks to a shared
          Trello board, but each student must submit 3-4 total by the end of
          week 4. They will submit the links in Ilearn at that time as well to
          aid the instructor in grading this participation.
        </p>
        <p>
          During weeks 5-12 of the semester items will be chosen from the list,
          assigned a complexity and time, and the class will learn to re-create
          the example. When one is done another will be chosen. These can take
          anywhere from a few days to up to three weeks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Spend a few minutes each week highlighting some of the ideas to build
          excitement and remind the students they are supposed to be paying
          attention to the sites they visit.
        </p>

        <p>
          As you start a new example begin by helping the students to
          deconstruct the problem. Ideally this will result in the students
          having a list of technologies that they will need to study in order to
          solve the problem, and a rough blueprint for how to proceed. The
          instructor can give them some resources to help with this, but the
          students should be encouraged to find their own as well and to share
          what they learn with the rest of the class.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use this:
          <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/"
            >Collection of learning modules</a
          >
          as a starting point for resources.
        </p>

        <h2>Repeating students</h2>
        <p>
          For students taking the course for a second time, use them to help
          curate the ideas being submitted during the first four weeks. They can
          help you prioritize the list, and get an initial estimate of
          complexity. They are welcome to submit their own examples as well. You
          could even get them started on solving one of the examples early if
          they need more to do. You could perhaps have them share their solution
          with the rest of the class as an introduction to week5.
        </p>

        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <p>
          Our goal is not to just solve the problems, but solve them using best
          practices as well. As you select examples to work on watch for
          opportunities to insert things from the following list as additional
          requirements as needed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Architecture and organization: BEM, Atomic Design, OOCSS, CUBE, etc
          </li>
          <li>Debugging and Optimization techniques</li>
          <li>SCSS usage</li>
          <li>Accessability</li>
          <li>Progressive enhancement</li>
          <li>Compatibility</li>
          <li>???</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Course Setup</h2>
        <p>
          You will need to create a Microsoft Team for your section, and add all
          of your students. If you would prefer Slack that is fine as well. You
          will also need to create a Trello board and add the students to that
          as well. Post the link to the board in the messaging system you have
          chosen.
        </p>
        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>
          Each week the students will be required to complete a reflection on
          what they learned that week, along with any questions or requests for
          feedback from the instructor. These will make up 30% of the student's
          final grade. The other 70% of the grade will come from a
          self-evaluation of themselves on the course Outcomes. This can be done
          in one of two ways.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The student can schedule a meeting with the instructor for a
            face-to-face meeting during the last week of the semester. This is
            done as an interview where the student offers a claim of mastery,
            and the instructor challenges as needed. The student should answer
            the challenges by showing examples of their work that they feel
            justify their claim.
          </li>
          <li>
            The student can prepare a short video of themselves giving their
            self-evaluation along with examples of the work they have completed
            over the semester that back up their claims. The links to the work
            should be submitted with the review as a portfolio.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Here are two resources that can help you and the students prepare for
          this:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="outcomes.html">Course Outcomes</a></li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://codepen.io/TimGuignard/pen/NdzXyQ"
              >Good warmup exercise for the interview.</a
            >
            You might ask the student to review this Codepen and respond to the
            following prompt: "What process would you follow if you were trying
            to figure out how to re-create the example?" I will often have them
            give their answer and then say: 'let's do it!' and dig into it
            together for a few minutes. If done during a face-to-face interview
            you can usually tell exactly where a student is in relation to the
            outcomes after this discussion.
