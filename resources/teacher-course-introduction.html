        <h1>WDD 331 Course Introduction</h1>

        <hr />

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This course is designed in a way that tries to recognize that most of
          the specific technologies we could study related to CSS will change.
          The placement of the first outcome is not random.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          1. Solve problems through independent study and applicationâ€”learn how
          to learn.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          It is the most important thing the students could gain from this
          course.
        </p>
        <p>
          This course is also repeatable. The course design is also to
          accommodate that. The first four weeks are set, they will always be
          the same thing:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Review and introduction</li>
          <li>Selectors</li>
          <li>SCSS</li>
          <li>Zen Garden introduction</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Also during those first four weeks the students will be asked to pay
          close attention to every website they visit. They should take note of
          anything that catches their attention. They are looking for things
          that the builder of the site has done that they think are cool and
          that they would be interested in learning how to replicate. The ideas
          can be submitted at anytime during the first 4 weeks to a shared
          Trello board, but each student must submit 3-4 total by the end of
          week 4. They will submit the links in Ilearn at that time as well to
          aid the instructor in grading this participation.
        </p>
        <p>
          During weeks 5-12 of the semester items will be chosen from the list,
          assigned a complexity and time, and the class will learn to re-create
          the example. When one is done another will be chosen. These can take
          anywhere from a few days to up to three weeks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Spend a few minutes each week highlighting some of the ideas to build
          excitement and remind the students they are supposed to be paying
          attention to the sites they visit.
        </p>
        <h2>Working the examples</h2>
        <p>
          You should plan on holding a weekly office hour or lab. Try and find a
          time that works for as many students as possible, then record and post
          it for those that can't make it. You can use this time to respond to
          questions on ongoing examples, give a post-mortem on a finished
          example, or to kick off a new example.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you start a new example begin by helping the students to
          deconstruct the problem. Ideally this will result in the students
          having a list of technologies that they will need to study in order to
          solve the problem, and a rough blueprint for how to proceed. The
          instructor can give them some resources to help with this, but the
          students should be encouraged to find their own as well and to share
          what they learn with the rest of the class.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use this:
          <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/learning-modules/"
            >Collection of learning modules</a
          >
          (work in progress) as a starting point for resources.
        </p>

        <h2>Repeating students</h2>
        <p>
          For students taking the course for a second time, use them to help
          curate the ideas being submitted during the first four weeks. They can
          help you prioritize the list, and get an initial estimate of
          complexity. They are welcome to submit their own examples as well. You
          could even get them started on solving one of the examples early if
          they need more to do. You could have them share their solution with
          the rest of the class as an introduction to week5. If face-to-face
          they can take a few minutes in class, if online ask them to prepare a
          short video talking about the process they followed and what they
          learned that can be shared with the class.
        </p>
        <p>
          After week 4 the course will run the same for repeating students as
          for the other students.
        </p>

        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <p>
          You have the option of collaborating with the other WDD 331
          instructors to reduce the amount of time spent in preparation. One way
          this could look is that in week 4 the instructors that would like to
          collaborate would meet and discuss the submitted examples. Together
          all the involved instructors would come up with a curated list. All
          the sections would then work through the same list. This would allow
          the sharing of resources and ideas between sections.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Course Lead would always be willing to participate in the
          collaboration, if other instructors are interested.
        </p>
        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <p>
          Our goal is not to just solve the problems, but solve them using best
          practices as well. As you select examples to work on watch for
          opportunities to insert things from the following list as additional
          requirements as appropriate:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Architecture and organization: BEM, Atomic Design, OOCSS, CUBE, etc
          </li>
          <li>Debugging and Optimization techniques</li>
          <li>SCSS usage</li>
          <li>Accessability</li>
          <li>Progressive enhancement</li>
          <li>Compatibility</li>
          <li>???</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Course Setup</h2>
        <p>
          You will need to create a Microsoft Team for your section, and add all
          of your students. If you would prefer Slack that is also fine.
          Communicate to the class which platform you will be using. You will
          also need to create a Trello board and add the students to that as
          well. Post the link to the board in the messaging system you have
          chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use this
          <a
            href="https://trello.com/invite/b/IKCrSCNx/31708663206715f2fc04f1a8ef895955/template"
            >board</a
          >
          as a starting point. That link will invite you to the board...then you
          can go into settings and copy it you your Trello account. You can
          either send an invite to each student to join your board (copy/paste
          the list of emails into the invite box), or enable the invite link and
          send it to the class.
        </p>
        <h2>Student Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          Students can receive feedback in one of two ways. First they can ask
          in the weekly reflection that they will be completing each week.
          Second they can ask the instructor at anytime for specific feedback on
          something they are working on. Encourage students to take advantage of
          this. Because the final grade is not directly tied to the assignments
          they are working on (see below) it frees the instructor to offer as
          much help as needed. Students have a bit of trouble adapting to this
          so encourage them to come with questions <strong>before</strong> the
          due dates!
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the assignments are formative...their purpose is to help the
          student learn and not to assess what they know. See below for how the
          assessment will take place.
        </p>

        <h2>Grading</h2>
        <p>
          Each week the students will be required to complete a reflection on
          what they learned that week, along with any questions or requests for
          feedback from the instructor. These will make up 30% of the student's
          final grade. The other 70% of the grade will come from a
          self-evaluation of themselves on the course Outcomes. This can be done
          in one of two ways.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The student can schedule a meeting with the instructor for a
            synchronous (face-to-face or online) meeting during the last week of
            the semester. This is done as an interview where the student offers
            a claim of mastery, and the instructor challenges as needed. The
            student should answer the challenges by showing examples of their
            work that they feel justify their claim.
          </li>
          <li>
            The student can prepare a short video of themselves giving their
            self-evaluation along with examples of the work they have completed
            over the semester that back up their claims. The links to the work
            should be submitted with the review as a portfolio.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I would recommend picking one of these methods and have all students
          do it that way for consistency. Here are two resources that can help
          you and the students prepare for this:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="outcomes.html">Course Outcomes</a></li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://codepen.io/TimGuignard/pen/NdzXyQ"
              >Good warmup exercise for the interview.</a
            >
            You might ask the student to review this Codepen and respond to the
            following prompt: "What process would you follow if you were trying
            to figure out how to re-create the example?" I will often have them
            give their answer and then say: 'let's do it!' and dig into it
            together for a few minutes. If done during a synchronous interview
            you can usually tell exactly where a student is in relation to the
            outcomes after this discussion.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Warning!</h2>
        <p>
          Because the assignments are not graded for points, they do not
          immediately affect the student's grade. We have removed the 'big
          stick'. Sometimes that results in the students lowering the priority
          on time spent in this class. Warn them about doing this. If you sense
          a problem with priority, you could always add an assignment in the LMS
          and have the students turn in the examples they work up. This would be
          added when you negotiate with the class which example will be done
          next, and how much time will be given to it so that you know when to
          set the due date for.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would recommend that you treat these submissions as mostly
          pass/fail. The course design attempts to free up as much of the
          instructor time as possible to advise and guide, and as little as
          possible grading. Try not to lose too much of your time in grading
          these submissions if you choose to add them. Follow the pattern of
          letting the student request feedback as needed, and let the assignment
          submission 'due date' provide a bit of extra incentive to get the work
          done.
