            <div class="callout">
                <p>We make a big deal about "Teach One Another" here. This often gets implemented as groupwork. This is
                    not a bad thing no matter how you personally may feel about it. Turns out most jobs <strong>will</strong>
                    require you to work with others.</p>
                <p>Teachers often make too many assumptions however about how much our students know about <em>how</em>
                    to work in a group. Here are a few tips and tricks to help you out with group projects.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Common Issues with groups</h2>
            <p>The following are common complaints I hear from students about working in groups:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>It's too hard to coordinate schedules</li>
                <li>Not everyone in the group contributes evenly</li>
                <li>I'm never sure what I should be doing</li>
                <li>It's too hard to keep everyone in the group on the same page and doing the right thing at the right
                    time.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Do you notice the common thread? Successful group work really comes down to how well you <strong>communicate</strong>
                with each other.</p>
            <p>Let me share a few tips and tools you can use to help.</p>
            <h2>Tips and Tools</h2>

            <p>To be honest, in a school group project schedule coordination is probably the hardest thing to
                accomplish. In a work environment (what we are trying to emulate with group work), you have the
                advantage that everyone is expected to be around and somewhat available M-F, 8-5. That is not the case
                in school.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately the only advice I can offer here is that when you are in a group you will have to make it
                a priority. Make time wherever you can so that you don't let your group down. But, you can try and
                minimize the amount of time you all need to be together at once...try to make your group function as
                asynchronously as you can.</p>
            <p>In order to do that you will need a few things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A good way to communicate</li>
                <li>A good way of tracking and assigning tasks</li>
                <li>A way to avoid stepping on each others toes when working on similar areas of the project.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Here are a few tools that the pros use to accomplish those things.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a>: If there was one tool that most
                        developers rely on for communication it would be Slack. Slack is an online communication tool
                        that is easy to setup and free to use.</p>
                    <p>On regular intervals your group should be checking in with each other to give updates on
                        progress. These meetings should be very quick, and while they would be syncronous in the ideal
                        setting...they can certainly be accomplished asynchronously as well.</p>
                    <p>Setup a Slack channel for your group and then once a day for short projects, or once or twice a
                        week for longer ones each member of the team should be required to check in with Slack and
                        report their progress.</p>
                    <p>In these meetings members usually report: What I've done since I last reported, what I am
                        planning on doing next, and if I'm stuck on anything.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a>: I'm a big fan of Trello for tracking
                        tasks. This is another free tool that you should take advantage of in your groups. Create a
                        board with a minimum of the following lists: Backlog, Defects, Doing, and Done, then invite all
                        the members of your group to the board.</p>
                    <div class="fig-block">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../images/trello-example.jpg" alt="Example of a Trello board">
                            <figcaption>Example of a Trello project board.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <p>At the beginning of the project the group's first job is to get together and fill out the
                        Backlog list. This initial list building REALLY needs to be done syncronously (all hands on
                        deck meeting). Every single task should be broken into as small of pieces as makes sense, and
                        entered
                        in there. (A good benchmark is that most tasks should take less than 30 minutes to complete)</p>
                    <p>Anytime someone thinks of something else that needs to be done it should immediately be added to
                        the backlog list.</p>
                    <p>Then whenever a member has time to work on the project, they can login to Trello, put their face
                        on a card (assign the card to themselves), and move it into Doing. This way you can always see
                        who is working on what, and what still needs to be done.</p>
                    <p>Make sure to move your tasks to Done when you finish them!</p>
                    <p> One really nice side effect of working this way is at the end of the project there is no
                        question about who did what...or who did nothing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>: Every successful team needs a way to
                        share what they have done with each other. Github is one popular way to do that (<a href="https://bitbucket.org"
                            target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> is another popular alternative). These tools track changes,
                        which is awesome for groups. They do take a bit of effort to learn how to use effectively, but
                        it is totally worth it! If you do a search you will find many free resources to
                        help you master them.</p>
                    <p>One other suggestion for managing code would be to break it down into small pieces. Spread your
                        code across many small files with each accomplishing one thing, instead of trying to get
                        everything together in one large, hard to maintain file. This also helps you to avoid having
                        conflicts on committed code. </p>
                </li>
            </ol>


            <h2>Putting it together</h2>
            <p>Lets look at how this might look on any given day for a member of a group if you setup your project with
                these tools (or something similar)</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Login to Slack and see what updates there are from team members.</li>
                <li>Open Trello and look over the Backlog, and Doing lists.</li>
                <li>Assign myself to a new task and move it to "Doing"</li>
                <li>Make sure to "Pull" from the code repository (either Github or Bitbucket) to get any changes my
                    teammates might have finished.</li>
                <li>Open my editor and complete the Task I grabbed.</li>
                <li>"Commit" and "Push" my code back up to the Repository for my teammates.</li>
                <li>Move the task I just finished in Trello over to "Done"</li>
                <li>Make any updates to Slack that your group might need to know about what you did.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Wrapping up</h2>
            <p>I should finish by saying two things: first, these tips and tools will make the biggest difference in
                group projects that must be completed and turned in as a group, but they can also be applied with
                success in learning groups. Second, these are not the only tools available to solve these
                problems...and none of them are required to use. But adopting them or something like them in your Group
                Project workflows can make a huge difference on your success and enjoyment in working in groups!</p>
